# Bibliographic Tools

## Sci-Hub

Sci-Hub is the 'Pirate Bay of academia' and provides an archive of journal papers searchable by DOI. If you are not affiliated to an institution this is a godsend for obtaining access to journal articles. More information including links can be found on [the Sci-Hub subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/scihub/wiki/index).

## Zotero

Zotero is an open-source bibliography management software. You can use it to organise papers, generate references, and it can attach PDF copies of articles to entries in its database. Available at <https://www.zotero.org/>.

### Sci-Hub integration

You can integrate Zotero with Sci-Hub to automatically retrieve PDFs of articles you save. One option is the [ethanwillis/zotero-scihub](https://github.com/ethanwillis/zotero-scihub) extension, or you can also [edit the Zotero setting](https://gagarine.medium.com/use-sci-hub-with-zotero-as-a-fall-back-pdf-resolver-cf139eb2cea7) `extensions.zotero.findPDFs.resolvers` to point directly as Sci-Hub.

## Library Genesis

Library Genesis, also LibGen, is repository of books, particularly excellent for finding copies of textbooks.

## IDEAS/RePEc

IDEAS is the Internet's largest bibliographic database dedicated to economics. In addition to providing a well-organised and searchable catalogue of journal articles and working papers, its entries often link to open-access PDFs. Available at <https://ideas.repec.org/>.
