# Comparative advantage

Given two producers A and B and two goods X and Y, we say that A has comparative advantage in producing X when A has a lower [[opportunity-cost]] of producing X relative to Y, compared to B. Algebraically, if $q_{AX}(i)$ is the quantity of X produced by A given inputs i, the opportunity cost of producing X instead of Y is the amount of Y which could have been produced instead, i.e. $q_{AY}(i)$. Because X and Y are different goods, and because A and B may produce them at different levels of efficiency, it is easier to compare the marginal opportunity cost (see [[marginal-value]]) of how much X can be made instead of making one unit of Y, which is the ratio $q_{AX} / q_{AY}$. Thus A has comparative advantage over B in X if $q_{AX} / q_{AY} > q_{BX} / q_{BY}$. By rearranging the inequality, it follows that B must have comparative advantage over A in Y.

Comparative advantage provides an explanation why different countries (or other economic agents) choose to specialise and trade with each other even if they possess [[absolute advantage]] in all goods: the total production is maximised when each agent specialises in producing goods for which they possess comparative advantage, and so if agents can trade freely, they can both benefit producing efficiently and then trading their excess production for other goods. In other words, comparative advatage specialization moves the market closer towards [[pareto-efficiency]].
