# Absolute advantage

For two producers A and B who both produce quantities of a good $q_A(i)$ and $q_B(i)$ subject to some inputs $i$, we say that A has absolute advantage over B if A can produce the same amount as B with less inputs, i.e. $q_A(i_A) = q_B(i_B)\ \text{s.t.} \ i_A < i_B$. In other words, A is a more efficient producer of the good than B, being able to produce the same amount while consuming less, or being able to produce more while consuming the same amount.
