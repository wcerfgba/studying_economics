# 2SLS (two-stage least squares)

A [[regression]] technique that extends [[ols]] to handle endogenous variables (see [[endogeneity]]). Consider a typical linear model:

$$
y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_2 + \beta_2 z_1 + u_1
$$

where $y_1$ is the dependent variable, $y_2$ is an endogenous explanatory variable ($Corr(y_2, u_1) \neq 0$) and $u_1$ is the error term. Because $y_2$ is endogenous, an estimation of this model with OLS will be biased.
