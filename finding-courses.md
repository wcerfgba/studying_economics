# Finding courses

Google or other search engines are very useful for finding course pages at universities which contain resources such as syllabi and problem sets. For example, try searching for "econometrics problem set" and you will find many courses at various universities with some mix of these resources available for download.

Institutional websites often provide plenty of resources linked from department websites. Usually you can follow a path such as:

* Department > Programmes > Courses > Syllabus, reading list
* Department > Faculty > Member Homepage > Courses > Syllabus, reading list, problem sets

Please contribute any materials to this repo so they are available for other people to use. ðŸ˜ƒ
