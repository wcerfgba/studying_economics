                The exam was administered in three parts</span></small></font><font size="+1"><small> (Part I during the last week of classes,

        <div align="left"><br>
          <b>Part I. (100 points total; 80 minutes total) Questions
            based on the last third of the course </b><br>
          <br>
          Question 1 (15 points; 7 minutes)<br>
          The Fed decides to lower interest rates. Interest rates in
          other countries do not change. Explain why the decrease in
          interest rates in the U.S. changes exchange rates, and why the
          change in exchange rates affects net exports. Be sure to note
          whether the dollar is becoming weaker or stronger relative to
          foreign currencies.<br>
          <br>
          Question 2 (10 points; 5 minutes)<br>
          Explain this sentence: “Banks create money by making loans
          with their excess reserves.” Define “money” and “excess
          reserves” before explaining the sentence itself. Be sure your
          explanation makes clear why excess reserves are key.<br>
          <br>
          Question 3 (21 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Policy – fiscal, monetary, or
          some combination – is needed when the economy is in
          equilibrium but there is an output gap. Why?<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Congress is considering two
          bills. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill 101: Reduce
          spending by the federal government on transportation
          (highways, airports, rail), the environment, and education.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill 202: Impose a 2
          percent tax on household wealth if a household’s wealth is
          more than $50 million. No tax is paid by households with under
          $50 million in wealth.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill 101 would cut spending by $100 billion
          per year. Bill 202 would generate tax revenue of $100 billion
          per year. Which bill would have the larger effect on
          employment? Why?<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Referring again to
          Congressional Bill 101 and Congressional Bill 102 above, what
          effect would each of the two bills have on the government’s
          budget deficit? Defend your answer. Be sure your defense
          includes the equation for calculating the budget deficit.<br>
          <br>
          Question 4 (8 points, 4 minutes) <br>
          What is a “yield curve”? What does it mean for the yield curve
          to be “inverted”? Draw a typical, normal, not-inverted yield
          curve at the right. Be sure to label axes, curves, and a
          representative point or two.<br>
          <br>
          Question 5 (21 points, 10 minutes)<br>
          This question refers to article #24, “The Famous ‘Phillips
          Curve’ to Predict Inflation Isn’t Working Like It Should.”<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) What is the basic relationship
          captured with the Phillips Curve? What relationship did A.W.
          Phillips actually study, and over what time period? What
          events have led people to say the Phillips curve “isn't
          working” today?<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) What are “inflationary
          expectations”? Explain why an increase in inflationary
          expectations will shift the Phillips Curve. Draw a graph at
          the right to supplement your answer.<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Why is knowing whether the
          Phillips curve relationship is “not working” or is instead
          “shifting” so important to Federal Reserve policy makers? (We
          think there is more space here than you will need to answer
          this question.)<br>
          <br>
          Question 6 (17 points, 8 minutes)<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) “The Fed is guided by a dual
          mandate.” What does that sentence mean?<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12=3+5+4 points) Suppose the Taylor Rule
          that describes the Fed’s behavior is<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FFR target = 2.5 + 3*(inflation rate - 2) -
          1.5*(unemployment rate - 4)<br>
          Suppose this economy is initially at the Fed’s goals for
          inflation and unemployment. What will the FFR target be in
          that case? <br>
          <br>
          Now suppose an economic crisis occurs and the actual inflation
          rate in this economy jumps to 5 percent while the unemployment
          rate rises to 6 percent. Now what will the FFR target be? (You
          might be able to do the math in your head, but you must at a
          minimum write out the equation you are calculating, even if
          you then do the math in your head. Answers with no supporting
          work will receive a 0.)<br>
          <br>
          Would you describe this Fed as relatively dovish or relatively
          hawkish? Why?<br>
          <br>
          Question 7 (8 points, 4 minutes)<br>
          What do we mean by the phrase “Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)”? If the
          economy is in a recession and we hit the ZLB, what policy
          options can we use to try to end the recession? Discuss.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Part II. Questions from the entire course (40 points total;
            1 hour total)</b><br>
          <br>
          8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) If the central bank wants to
          increase aggregate demand, what will their monetary policy be?
          Explain why their policy will affect investment spending (all
          else constant). A complete answer will include reference to
          the yield curve and to both internal and external finance.
          There is no need to discuss the methods of policy
          implementation (IOER, ON RRP, etc).<br>
          <br>
          9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) An economy that is operating
          at capacity (on its PPF) cannot increase total production
          without triggering an inflation problem. What is one policy
          that the federal government can pursue to allow an economy to
          produce beyond its current capacity? Is there a policy the
          central bank can pursue to also allow production beyond the
          current PPF? Discuss.<br>
          <br>
          10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) One contribution many of us
          make to climate change is taking airplane flights. Suppose a
          tax of $200 per flight is assessed on every airline passenger.
          Why would this tax probably have a greater effect on the
          number of flights taken by leisure travelers than on the
          number of flights taken by business travelers? What does this
          tell you about the current consumer surplus enjoyed by leisure
          travelers versus business travelers? Explain your answers.
          Include a definition of “consumer surplus.”<br>
          <br>
          11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) The pattern of housing
          prices 1990-2010 is perfectly predictable using simple
          principles of supply &amp; demand. One factor was increased
          availability of mortgage credit starting in the late 1990s.
          Explain the rise and fall of housing prices from the late
          1990s through 2010. Why would you predict that housing prices
          would have risen more in areas with little available land
          (eg., San Francisco) than in areas with lots of available land
          (eg., Phoenix)? Draw a market graph that illustrates your
          answer.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Part III. Comprehensive Essay Question (60 points)</b><br>
          <br>
          Congratulations! You will be an intern at the SF Fed, working
          for President Mary C. Daly. (She’s awesome! Check out her life
          story at
          https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/success/mary-daly-federal-reserve/index.html
          and elsewhere.) She will be giving a talk before a group of AP
          Econ high school students from the Bay Area and she’s asked
          you to prepare a first draft of her comments. She’s provided
          you with an outline. You and she agree that AP econ students
          are probably familiar with the vocab (so there’s no need to
          define each term) but are not necessarily familiar with the
          economic arguments. She says including graphs from Fred where
          appropriate would be fine.<br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general topic of her talk will be the
          next U.S. recession and why the Fed may be constrained in
          fighting it.<br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Pres. Daly wants a clear discussion
          of the factors that may contribute to the next recession. One
          concern is the weakness of investment spending, which could be
          related to heightened uncertainty as well as depressed future
          forecasts. The other concern is the weakness of net exports,
          tied to the trade war, U.S. tariffs, and retaliatory tariffs
          put in place by other countries. <br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pres. Daly suggests using a micro example
          to illustrate how U.S. tariffs might impact consumer prices of
          imported goods, and then linking that to inflation as measured
          by the CPI. <br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remind the audience that the Fed faces a
          dual mandate (that’s probably some vocab that is worth
          defining). In this section, Pres. Daly wants to first discuss
          how the Fed typically responds to a recession. What monetary
          policy does the Fed typically pursue, and how would it be
          implemented?<br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After discussing the typical response,
          Pres. Daly wants to spend time discussing the challenges the
          Fed will face in fighting the next recession. Her initial
          thoughts are to include at least the following<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will typical Fed policy
          be effective in increasing aggregate demand, given the likely
          factors contributing to the next recession?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal funds rate
          target is currently 1.50-1.75 percent and the IOER is 1.55
          percent. What is the “zero lower bound” (ZLB) and why does the
          ZLB create a challenge for Fed policy? If the Fed hits the ZLB
          during a recession, what options remain for fighting a
          recession?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Phillips curve
          relationship between unemployment &amp; inflation may (or may
          not) have changed over the last two decades. In what ways, if
          any, is this relevant to the Fed’s ability to fight the next
          recession?<br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, not for her speech but because
          Pres. Daly is a great mentor, she is interested in your
          personal thoughts. How dovish do you think the Fed should be
          in fighting the next recession? Why?<br>

        <div align="left"><b><br>
            Part I. (68 points total; 1 hour total) Questions based on
            the last third of the course </b><br>
          <br>
          Question 1. (10 points; 9 minutes)<br>
          What is “money”? Who creates money? Explain how money is
          created.<br>
          <br>
          Question 2. (12 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) What is the “government’s
          budget deficit”? Does a tax cut increase or decrease the
          budget deficit (circle the answer)?<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Explain why a tax cut leads to
          a smaller total increase in GDP than does an equal sized
          increase in government spending. (Simply writing down a
          formula is not an explanation.)<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) The December 2017 Trump Tax
          Cut primarily benefited corporations and high income or
          wealthy individuals. Why was the effect of the tax cut on the
          economy therefore smaller than it would have been if the tax
          cut had primarily affected low and middle income people?<br>
          <br>
          Question 3. (22 points; 20 minutes) <br>
          Suppose aggregate demand, C + I + G + EX - IM, can be
          simplified to the following equation<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AD = 900 - 60*i + 0.4Y<br>
          The units are billions of dollars per month, and an interest
          rate of 1 percent is measured as 1 (not 0.01).<br>
          Suppose the Taylor Rule for this economy is<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i = 4 + 2*(actual - goal inflation rate) -
          1*(actual - goal unemployment rate)<br>
          The goal inflation rate is 2 percent (use 2, not 0.02) and the
          goal unemployment rate is 4 percent (use 4, not 0.04).<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Is the central bank in this
          economy relatively hawkish or dovish? Defend your answer.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) Suppose the interest rate is
          initially 5 percent. What is the equilibrium level of income
          in this economy?<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11 points) At the level of income you
          determined in part A, the unemployment rate is 3.5 percent and
          the inflation rate is 3 percent. What interest rate target
          will the central bank now set? Will this new interest rate
          target bring the economy closer to the central bank’s goals
          for unemployment and inflation? Explain.<br>
          <br>
          Question 4. (12 points; 10 minutes)&nbsp; <br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) In today’s economy, it’s
          harder for workers to get promoted. In 2006, it took an
          average of 2 ½ years to get a promotion; today it takes 4 ½
          years. As a result, fewer workers are willing to boost their
          productivity in an effort to impress the boss and get the
          promotion. In 2006, 25 percent of employees said they were
          willing to give “an extra oomph” at work (boost their
          productivity); today about 15 percent are willing to do so.
          Explain the connection to the Phillips curve.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) When an employer lists a job
          opening, they receive hundreds of applications. Eightfold is a
          new product that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to scan
          resumes and quickly and accurately identify the applicants who
          are the best fit for the job. An economist who studied the use
          of AI in hiring said, “You get the more nontraditional,
          equally qualified, equally high-performing people, but the
          employer doesn’t seem to have to compete for them as much.”
          What effect might the use of AI have on the slope of the
          Phillips curve and why?<br>
          <br>
          Question 5. (12 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9 points) On Nov. 28, Fed Chairman
          Powell said the current FFR=2.25% is “just below” the neutral
          rate. That was a surprise; most people thought the neutral
          rate was about 4 percent. Why did Powell’s statement cause
          long-term interest rates to fall? How does that affect the
          slope of the yield curve? Illustrate at the right with two
          yield curves — one for before and one for after Powell’s
          statement.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) One reason the stock market
          fell so much last week was that many (many!) analysts said “Oh
          no! This change in the slope of the yield curve means a
          recession [a drop in aggregate demand] is imminent!” Do you
          agree? Why or why not?<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part II. Questions from the entire course (72 points total;
            1 hour total)</b><br>
          <br>
          Question 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          Explain why an increase in interest rates in the U.S.
          decreases aggregate demand. Note which effect(s) occur if the
          increase in interest rates is experienced throughout the
          world, and which effect(s) occur only if the increase in
          interest rates is experienced only in the U.S. Be complete.<br>
          <br>
          Question 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          The government climate change report issued November 23, 2018
          predicts a 10 percent drop in U.S. GDP by 2100 due to climate
          change. There are multiple sources. <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be increasingly common and
          severe natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,
          wildfires)<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean-up and rebuilding after natural
          disasters will require reallocating resources from other
          economic activities<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Infrastructure will be damaged or
          destroyed more frequently due to the increasingly common
          natural disasters<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) Explain why and under what
          circumstances the clean-up and rebuilding after a natural
          disaster requires a reduction in other economic activities.
          Use a production possibilities frontier to illustrate your
          explanation. Put clean-up &amp; rebuilding “(C&amp;R)” on one
          axis.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Explain the effect of damage
          and destruction of infrastructure on economic growth. Tell us
          how you would illustrate this in a PPF (but don’t actually
          draw it).<br>
          <br>
          Question 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          Lake Tahoe is a year-round vacation destination on the
          California/Nevada border. Houses near Lake Tahoe can be
          occupied by owners, by long-term renters who live year-round
          and work at Tahoe, or by short-term vacationers (Airbnb
          rentals). South Lake Tahoe is one town located on the lake. On
          November 6, voters in South Lake Tahoe banned vacation home
          rentals (Airbnb rentals) in their town. The ban takes effect
          on December 20. The ban was favored by people who live and
          work at Tahoe. The ban was opposed by people who own vacation
          home rentals. Assume the market for rental houses is
          monopolistically competitive and before Nov. 6 was in a
          long-run equilibrium.<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the benefits of the vacation home
          rental ban for people who live year-round at Tahoe? Why would
          owners of vacation home rentals be opposed to the ban? In the
          long run, who will own houses in South Lake Tahoe? Be sure
          you’ve explained each of your answers.<br>
          <br>
          Question 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points; 10 minutes)<br>
          The market for oil can be modeled as one worldwide market.
          OPEC (Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries) is an
          organization of 15 oil-producing countries. OPEC met last week
          and decided to decrease oil production by 1.2 million barrels
          per day.<br>
          <i>(Not relevant to the question but FYI: The two largest
            oil-exporters in OPEC are Russia and Saudi Arabia. The US is
            not a member of OPEC but due to technological change
            (fracking) and regulatory reform, the US has recently become
            the #1 producer of oil in the world.)</i><i><br>
          </i>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) What effect should OPEC’s
          decision have on the price of oil? Why? Draw a supply and
          demand diagram that supports your answer.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) OPEC made this decision in
          part because oil prices have been falling due to decreased
          worldwide demand for oil. What does this information suggest
          is the proper counterfactual to use when analyzing the effect
          on price of OPEC restricting production?<br>
          <br>
          Question 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (24 points; 20 minutes)<br>
          Let’s think about gas taxes again. The global Paris Climate
          Agreement signed by 194 countries and the European Union calls
          on everyone to reduce global emissions to fight climate
          change. One strategy for doing so is by taxing purchases of
          gas (fuel taxes). But recently in France, there have been
          widespread protests against higher fuel taxes. The protests
          were led by commercial truck drivers (“truckers”) and poor and
          working class people.<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Explain why a tax in the
          presence of a negative externality can bring the market
          equilibrium quantity closer to the socially optimal quantity.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) What are the likely
          differences in the price elasticity of demand for gas (fuel)
          between truckers, poor-and-working-class people, and high
          income individuals? Defend your answer.<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Traditionally, a gas tax has
          been assessed as a constant amount per gallon or liter. For
          instance, according to the OECD, in 2013, gas taxes were $3.29
          per gallon in Germany, $1.25 per gallon in Canada, and $0.53
          per gallon in the U.S. Charging a constant amount per gallon
          means gas taxes are a regressive tax: poor and working class
          people pay a much higher share of their income in gas taxes
          than do high income people. Suggest and defend a tax scheme
          that will accomplish two goals: lower consumption of gas, but
          not disproportionately affect poor and working class people.<br>

          <b>Part III. Comprehensive Essay Question (60 points)</b><br>
          <br>
          You are an intern for a newly-elected Senator who has been
          appointed to the Senate Banking Committee. This committee
          confirms appointees to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
          There are currently 3 Board vacancies. The Senator-Elect wants
          you to prepare a briefing paper on monetary policy that can be
          used to prepare for questioning Board Chairman Powell or an
          appointee nominated by President Trump for one of the three
          Board vacancies.<br>
          <br>
          The Senator-Elect is an educated person with some background
          knowledge of economics, but has been out of college for a few
          decades. You were hired for this internship because of the
          breadth and depth of your economic knowledge and your ability
          to write. You don’t want to let the Senator-Elect down! <br>
          <br>
          Here’s your drafted outline. Most definitely, include at least
          the points noted below. You can include visual representations
          of data as appropriate (a figure can be worth a thousand
          words; Fred is a good source).<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Intro paragraph. Set the stage. This paragraph should
              tell the Senator-Elect the focus of the rest of the
              briefing paper.</li>
            <li>Inflation hawk or dove. Explain the dual mandate of the
              Fed and what it means to be a hawk or a dove. Give the
              Senator-Elect a sample question or two that could be asked
              in a hearing to determine whether Chairman Powell or a
              Board nominee is an inflation hawk or dove. </li>
            <li>Role of interest rates. The Senator-Elect needs to
              understand how changes in interest rates affect
              unemployment and inflation. This will be an important part
              of the briefing paper. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with the basics, explaining why higher interest
                rates slow economic growth, relative to the
                counterfactual. </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Need to explain the concept of the counterfactual in
                  this context!</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Include some caveats – examples of circumstances under
                which the chain of events from Fed policy to economic
                growth might not unfold as expected.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Connect economic growth to changes in unemployment and
              inflation. Why is there typically a tradeoff between
              unemployment and inflation?</li>
            <li>Address the puzzle of 2012-2016 when falling
              unemployment didn’t trigger rising inflation. What are the
              unanswered questions about the nature of the Phillips
              curve relationship? Offer the Senator-Elect a question to
              ask in a hearing to elicit the thoughts of the Chairman or
              a Board nominee.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Labor markets are part of the puzzle, so walk the
                Senator-Elect through an analysis of labor markets.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Concluding statement: What are the key points the
              Senator-Elect should keep in mind when questioning
              Chairman Powell or a Board nominee? </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          Question 1 (20 points total; 17 minutes total)<br>
          This question is based on reader article #24, “Federal Funds
          and Interest on Reserves,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
          and “FAQs about Interest on Reserves and the Implementation of
          Monetary Policy,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define IOER.
          Define FFR. When we talk about the FFR (also known as, FFER),
          what is the market we are discussing? (One phrase answers to
          each question are sufficient.)<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does
          the New York Fed traditionally use Federal Open Market
          Operations (FOMO) to facilitate an increase the FFR?&nbsp; Be
          specific about what actions are taken. Include a graph of the
          FF market in your answer.<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
          November 2008, who became the primary sellers of federal
          funds? How does this explain the fact that since 2008, the FFR
          has consistently been less than the IOER?<br>
          <br>
          Question 2 (8 points; 7 minutes)<br>
          Suppose the federal government passes a bill that
          simultaneously does two things:<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes are decreased for high wealth
          households, saving them a total of $100 billion per year<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transfer payments (Medicaid, Social
          Security) are decreased for low income and elderly households,
          with a total cut of $100 billion per year<br>
          What is the effect of this bill on aggregate demand (possible
          answers: increase, decrease, stay the same)? What is the
          effect of this bill on employment? Defend your answers.<br>
          <br>
          Question 3 (12 points total; 11 minutes total)<br>
          The Phillips curve remains, at least for now, a useful tool
          for monetary policy authorities.<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the
          right, draw and label a Phillips curve. Indicate on the curve
          approximately where the U.S. economy is currently.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fed (and
          other central banks around the globe) now practices “forward
          guidance.” What is forward guidance? How does the Fed’s use of
          forward guidance decrease the likelihood of the Phillips curve
          shifting?<br>
          <br>
          Question 4 (15 points total; 13 minutes total)<br>
          Estimated values of the Taylor rule for the U.S. Fed are
          expressed by the following equation. Subscripts “t” refer to
          the time period. When all subscripts are “t” that means we are
          using the values for those variables in the same time period.
          For instance, if t = 2017:I, then any variable with a
          subscript “t” refers to the 2017:I value of that variable. A
          variable with a subscript “t+1” refers to the 2017:II value of
          that variable.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target nominal FFRt = 4.63 + 1.28*(actual
          inflation ratet - 2.0) - 1.95*(actual unemployment ratet -
          4.7)<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using this
          estimated equation, what is the neutral value of the federal
          funds rate? What is the Fed’s target for the inflation rate?
          What is the Fed’s target for the unemployment rate?<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is an
          “inflation hawk”? What is an “inflation dove”? Based on this
          estimated equation, would you characterize the Fed as hawkish
          or dovish? Why?<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When setting
          the target for the FFR, the Fed is actually forward-looking.
          That is, the Fed considers both current values of inflation
          and also what the inflation rate would be in the near future
          if the Fed were to do nothing. Does the equation above (in the
          prompt) capture this forward-looking behavior? Defend your
          answer.<br>

          <b>Part II. Questions from the entire course (85 points total;

          </b><br>
          Question 5 (20 points total; 17 minutes total)<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does a
          decrease in interest rates typically lead to an increase in
          investment spending? In your answer, be sure to distinguish
          between the interest rate(s) that are relevant for firms using
          internal finance versus the interest rate(s) that are relevant
          for firms using external finance.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does a
          decrease in interest rates typically lead to an increase in
          net export spending? (Assume this economy is the only economy
          that decreases interest rates.) Be complete.<br>
          <br>
          Question 6 (7 points; 6 minutes)<br>
          The California economy, as measured by its real GDP, has been
          growing about 3.5 percent per year. Analysts expect that
          California’s economic growth will slow to about 2 percent per
          year as the economy reaches full employment and labor
          shortages appear.<br>
          Use one or more of these concepts to explain why analysts
          would expect growth to slow: PPF, AD, actual real GDP,
          potential real GDP.<br>

          Question 7 (15 points total; 13 minutes total)<br>
          San Francisco announced a new parking meter policy. Under the
          old policy, the price for an hour of parking was fixed at
          $2.50 per hour. Under the new policy, the price for an hour of
          parking will vary, neighborhood by neighborhood, hour by hour,
          depending upon how many parking places are available. If there
          are lots of empty parking places when the price is $2.50 per
          hour, the price for an hour of parking will be decreased. If
          there are no empty parking places when the price is $2.50 per
          hour, the price for an hour of parking will be increased.<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the right,
          draw a supply and demand graph that captures the new policy.
          Show an instance in which the price would be low. Show an
          instance in which the price would be high.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysts
          working for San Francisco believe the new policy will increase
          total revenue. Do we need to know the price-elasticity of
          demand for parking in order to determine if the new policy
          will increase revenue? Explain.<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparing
          the old policy (fixed price) and the new policy (variable
          price), what is the effect on consumer surplus at times when
          there are lots of empty parking places at a price of $2.50 per
          hour? At the right, sketch in the old and new CS. (Your graph
          at the right is your defense of your answer.)<br>

          <br>
          Question 8 (15 points total; 13 minutes total)<br>
          A recent study of taxes assessed on goods sold showed that
          sellers will raise prices when taxes are increased, but do not
          lower prices when taxes are decreased. <br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below, show
          the effect of an increase in a tax on the price of output in
          the short run and the long run, assuming the market is
          perfectly competitive. Assume the tax is a constant dollar
          amount. Assume the tax revenue is remitted to the government
          by the seller. Use subscripts “1" to depict the initial
          condition, subscripts “2" to depict the new short-run
          equilibrium, and subscripts “3" to depict the new long-run
          equilibrium. <br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result
          of this recent study is surprising. One explanation the
          authors offered for why businesses would not lower their
          prices when taxes are lowered was that business owners are
          loss averse. How might loss aversion explain the tendency of
          businesses to increase prices when taxes are raised, but not
          decrease prices when taxes are lowered. (No graph is required
          for this part.)<br>

          Question 9 (13 points total; 12 minutes total)<br>
          Invention and innovation increases total factor productivity.
          A recent study by Raj Chetty and co-authors found that those
          people who become inventors are far more likely to have been
          raised in families at the top 1 percent of the income
          distribution than in median-income families. Further analysis
          showed that an important underlying cause was that children in
          high income families grew up meeting, knowing, and talking
          with people who were themselves inventors, but that children
          in median-income families had no such exposure to inventors.
          Having childhood knowledge of the invention process, the
          authors argued, makes someone far more likely to become an
          inventor as an adult.<br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should
          the government be interested in a policy designed to encourage
          invention and innovation? Why doesn’t the Coase Theorem apply
          here?<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of
          this study, suggest one policy that might be implemented to
          encourage invention and innovation. Defend your suggestion.<br>

          Question 10 (15 points; 13 minutes total)<br>
          Chain restaurants include places such as Olive Garden,
          Cheesecake Factory, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Popeyes, Del Taco,
          Subway, and many more. <br>
          A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the
          2007-09 recession, sales at chain restaurants decreased. Would
          you therefore characterize “meals at chain restaurants” as a
          normal good or an inferior good? Defend your answer.<br>
          B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 point)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you
          characterize the chain restaurant industry as perfect
          competition, monopolistic competition, or monopoly?<br>
          C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the
          end of the recession in 2009 and 2015, sales at chain
          restaurants increased by 8 to 10 percent per year. That’s a
          huge annual increase. Starting in about 2010, there have been
          big increases each year in the number of chain restaurants.
          Explain why increased sales would lead to increases in the
          number of restaurants.<br>
          D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in
          2016, “same store sales” have declined over time. “Same store
          sales” excludes sales at stores that have entered or exited
          the industry in the last year. “Same store sales” includes
          only sales at stores (here, restaurants) that were in business
          last year and this year. Would our usual analysis of
          adjustment to long-run equilibrium have predicted this result?
          Explain.<br>

          <b>Part III. Comprehensive Essay Question (60 points)</b><br>
          You are finishing up a fabulous internship at an online
          news-and-opinion blog that focuses on economics issues. Your
          supervisor has given you one last assignment: Write a piece
          that provides some analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
          (TCJA, also known as the GOP Tax Plan). Your readers are
          educated people who have an interest in and background
          knowledge of economics.&nbsp; Your supervisor has been
          impressed with the breadth and depth of your economic
          knowledge and with your ability to write a clear and
          compelling article. You don’t want to let your supervisor
          down! <br>
          <br>
          Based on conversations with your supervisor, you decided you
          wanted to include the points below. You’re mostly happy with
          the outline but might re-order things for better flow. You can
          include visual representations of data as appropriate (a
          figure can be worth a thousand words), but no “textbook
          graphs” that illustrate economic concepts.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Preliminary Outline You Sketched Out for Yourself (which is
          why you referred to yourself as “I”)<br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Intro paragraph. Include a thesis statement here. Be
              sure reader knows that the specifics of TCJA vary between
              House and Senate versions (and are changing by the day),
              so I’ll mostly focus on the broad outlines.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Broad outlines that I’ll focus on: [1] lower taxes on
                income (revenue - accounting costs) of corporations; [2]
                eliminating taxes on wealth transfers (bequests) for
                estates larger than $5 million; and [3] changes in taxes
                for middle and lower income families (“change” because
                it could be an income tax decrease, could be an
                increase, depends on family location and circumstances)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a clear brief analysis of the effects of the tax
              plan on long-run economic growth, unemployment, inflation,
              and inequality. It probably will be most clear if I
              separately analyze the effects of each of the three things
              in my broad outline. I’ll have to think about what flows
              better: grouping by what’s being affected (LR growth,
              unemployment, etc) or grouping by aspect of the tax bill
              (corporate taxes, wealth taxes, income taxes).</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Discuss what the Fed will likely do in response. Here I
              need to focus especially on the predicted net effects on
              unemployment and inflation. I should be sure to explain
              (briefly anyway) what the Fed’s mandate is, and why they
              consider unemployment and inflation in determining policy.
              Important here to distinguish between today’s inflation,
              anticipated inflation, and inflationary expectations.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>There are lots and lots of particular provisions in the
              bills. To make my article more compelling, I’ll choose one
              particular provision and analyze it. </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Best place to find information needed here: Joint
                Committee on Taxation (https://www.jct.gov/) and
                especially
                https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=5031
                (House bill, “Description of H.R. 1") and
                https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=5032
                (Senate bill, “Description of the Chairman’s Mark of
                TCJA”)</li>
              <li>I’ll choose just one particular provision out of all
                that is in those two documents. Almost everything in the
                bill is the elimination (or change) of the amount of tax
                credit or deductibility (a subsidy) that taxpayers
                currently receive for spending on some particular
                thing.&nbsp; After I choose what one provision I will
                focus on, I want to discuss what particular (micro)
                market that provision will affect, what the effect is
                likely to be, and whether or not there had been a
                justification for the existing (pre TCJA) provision
                based on the existence of externalities.&nbsp; (For
                instance, if the bill suggests eliminating the ability
                to deduct from taxes a taxpayer’s spending on X, what
                will that do to prices and quantities in the market for
                X? And, is there an externality associated with spending
                on X that had justified the existing ability to deduct
                spending for X from one’s taxable income?)</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer a conclusion: Is the TCJA good or bad for the US
              economy? That’s a normative question, so I better state
              what I think the goal ought to be.</li>

                  Questions Covering the Last Third of the Course (58
                  points total; 45 minutes total)</b><br>
                Question 1 (10 points; 8 minutes)<br>
                Since the November 8 election, the dollar has
                strengthened by about 10 percent against the Mexican
                peso and by about 4 percent against the Euro. Explain
                how the following two events can account for these
                changes in the strength of the dollar.&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event A:
                Long-term interest rate in the US – but not in other
                countries – have increased by about ½ percentage point
                since November 8<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event B:
                President-Elect Trump's campaign comments about trade
                between Mexico and the US have led to the widely-held
                expectation that Mexican exports to the US will decrease
                markedly in 2017<br>
                <br>
                Question 2 (15 points total; 11 minutes total) <br>
                In normal times, banks hold very low levels of excess
                reserves.<br>
                A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) In normal times, what do
                banks typically do with their excess reserves?&nbsp; In
                normal times, approximately what amount of excess
                reserves do banks typically hold?<br>
                B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9 points) In normal times, what is
                the effect of an increase in the interest rate on excess
                reserves (IOER) on the federal funds rate (FFR)?
                Explain. Supplement your answer with a graph of the
                federal funds market.<br>
                <br>
                Question 3 (10 points; 8 minutes)<br>
                Large increases in government spending for
                transportation infrastructure projects will have a
                smaller effect on U.S. GDP in 2017-18 than the same size
                projects would have had in 2008-09.&nbsp; Referring to
                article #25 (“How Powerful are Fiscal Multipliers in
                Recessions?” by Alan Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko),
                explain why. <br>
                <br>
                Question 4 (10 points total; 8 minutes total)<br>
                Suppose the Taylor rule is<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                interest rate target&nbsp; = 3 - 2*(actual unemployment
                - 4 ) + 1*(actual inflation rate - 2 )<br>
                A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) According to this Taylor
                rule, what are the values of the neutral interest rate,
                the central bank's goal for the unemployment rate, and
                the central bank's goal for the inflation rate? (No
                explanation needed.)<br>
                B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) Suppose the actual
                unemployment rate is 9 and the actual inflation rate is
                0.&nbsp; What is the FFR target predicted by this Taylor
                Rule? Traditionally, would the central bank have a FFR
                target equal (or approximately equal) to the rate
                predicted by the Taylor Rule? Explain.<br>
                <br>
                Question 5 (13 points total; 10 minutes total)<br>
                Ruby, a small business owner, is considering buying
                additional machinery for her company.&nbsp; She has been
                denied a loan by the bank and is considering financing
                the purchase with her credit card. The interest rate
                charged by the bank for a loan is 8 percent. The credit
                card interest rate is 22 percent. <br>
                A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Should she buy the
                machinery? Explain your answer.<br>
                B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) The Presidential
                election results surprised Ruby.&nbsp; She now thinks
                inflation in 2017 - 2020 will be about 5 percent rather
                than the 2 percent she had been expecting.&nbsp; Does
                her change in expectations affect her decision to buy
                the machinery? Explain.<br>

                There are two groups of companies that can sell a
                product.&nbsp; Companies in both groups face a typical
                upward sloping marginal cost curve.&nbsp; But for group
                A, their minimum average variable cost is $8 and for
                group B, their minimum average variable cost is
                $50.&nbsp; There are a large number of companies in each
                group.&nbsp; Draw the market supply curve for this
                product.&nbsp; Explain why you drew the Supply curve as
                you did.&nbsp; Why will $50 be the market price for this

                Question 8 (6 points; 5 minutes)<br>
                A state government offers a company $7 million if it
                will decrease the number of employees by 1,600 rather
                than by 2,400. In 2016 the company had 3,000
                employees.&nbsp; In 2017, the company will have 1,400
                employees and receive $7 million from the state
                government. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From one
                perspective, the company is being paid $7 million for
                reducing its workforce by 1,600 employees.&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From another
                perspective, the company is being paid $7 million for
                increasing employment by 800 employees.&nbsp; <br>
                What is the proper counterfactual statement to use to
                evaluate the effectiveness of this policy of paying this

                Question 9 (15 points total; 11 minutes total)<br>
                Two policies are being considered to subsidize college
                educations at public universities such as Berkeley.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy A:&nbsp;
                Use tax revenues to pay subsidies equal to the cost of

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy B:&nbsp;
                Use tax revenues to pay subsidies equal to the cost of
                tuition to students whose families earn less than
                $125,000 per year.<br>
                A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Use the concept of
                externalities to explain why subsidizing college
                education makes economic sense.<br>
                B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9 points) Which policy -- Policy A
                or Policy B -- is more likely to generate the socially
                optimal quantity of public university graduates?&nbsp;
                Defend your answer.&nbsp; In your defense consider the
                price elasticity of demand for college education.&nbsp;
                Distinguish (if appropriate) between the price
                elasticities of the two groups of students -- those
                whose families earn more than $125,000 per year, and
                those whose families earn less than $125,000 per year.<br>
                <br>
                Question 10 (36 points total; 27 minutes total)<br>
                Manufacturers of goods buy parts that are used in
                production.&nbsp; For example, car manufacturers buy
                engines that are produced by other companies, and then
                put those engines into the cars they are manufacturing
                and selling. <br>
                <br>
                Suppose the parts that American manufacturers buy are
                produced in two places:&nbsp; in the US, or in other
                countries.&nbsp; You should think of those as two
                separate markets: the market for US produced parts, and
                the market for imported parts. Both markets for parts
                are perfectly competitive. The US-produced parts and
                imported parts are perfect substitutes. Currently,
                American goods manufacturers buy a mix of US-produced
                parts and imported parts. <br>
                <br>
                President-Elect Trump has suggested implementing a 35
                percent tariff (tax) on imported goods. A 35 percent
                tariff (tax on imports) means an imported part that had
                cost $1 to a US manufacturer would now cost $1.35, but
                the American-produced part would still cost just
                $1.&nbsp; The tariff is paid to the US federal
                government by the buyer.&nbsp; Assume there is currently
                no tariff, as is characteristic of a "free trade zone."<br>
                <br>
                A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Assume the
                parts-producing firms are initially in long-run
                competitive equilibrium.&nbsp; What is the short-run
                effect of the implementation of a 35 percent tariff on
                the price of parts imported from Mexico? On&nbsp; the
                profits of a&nbsp; typical Mexican company that produces
                parts?&nbsp; Explain and illustrate your answers. <br>
                B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) What is the short-run
                effect of the tariff on the price of parts produced in
                the US? Explain and illustrate your answer.<br>
                C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) What is the effect of
                the tariff on the inflation rate in the US?&nbsp; On the
                Phillips Curve? Explain your answers. Illustrate your
                Phillips Curve answer.<br>
                D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Given the Fed's dual
                mandate, what is the Fed likely to do in response to the
                implementation of a steep tariff?&nbsp; What is the
                likely effect on the Fed's monetary policy action on
                employment? Why does the mix of doves and hawks on the
                FOMC affect your answer? Explain your answers.<br>

                </b>You’ve decided to submit an op-ed to a reputable
                news-source read by millions of people around the world.
                You are going to offer your opinion of what the Fed
                should do at its December 13-14, 2016 FOMC meeting in
                light of the heightened uncertainty in the US economy
                post-November 8. Your readers are educated people who
                have only a rudimentary knowledge of economics.&nbsp;
                The editor who will decide whether to publish your op-ed
                needs to be impressed with the breadth and depth of your
                economic knowledge and with your ability to write a
                clear and compelling article.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                You sketched out the outline below. You can include
                visual representations of data as appropriate (a figure
                can be worth a thousand words), but the news source you
                are writing for doesn’t allow graphs that illustrate

                <br>
                Outline<br>
                <br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncertainty is greater
                post-election.&nbsp; Things seem to change daily.&nbsp;
                I could capture two aspects of the uncertainty:<br>
              </small></font></small>
          <blockquote><small><font size="+1"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiscal policy, interest rates,
                  inflation. Increased infrastructure spending ,
                  increased military spending, and tax cuts have been
                  proposed.&nbsp; (Details may still be missing.)&nbsp;
                  I should discuss the implications of such a package of
                  fiscal policies for employment &amp; inflation, while
                  noting the uncertainty around what will actually
                  happen.</small></font></small><br>
            <small><font size="+1"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trade policy.&nbsp; Again, lots of
                  uncertainty, but the talk has been about renegotiating
                  trade policies and reducing US imports. Eliminating
                  free trade zones would increase price of US exports to
                  foreigners. I should outline the possibilities here.</small></font></small><br>
          </blockquote>
          <small><font size="+1"><small>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effects of
                uncertainty.&nbsp; There are several points I want to
                make here so this section will probably be long.&nbsp;
                Effect of heightened uncertainty on aggregate investment
                spending.&nbsp; Effects on banking and lending, perhaps
                through impact on asymmetric information. Effect on the
                strength of the dollar vis-à-vis foreign currencies.
                Effect on aggregate consumption and saving.&nbsp; And
                effect on inflationary expectations.<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, monetary policy.&nbsp; I should
                first discuss Federal Reserve monetary policy in general
                terms.&nbsp; What are the Fed’s goals? What data do they
                examine in deciding policy? Why have they been planning
                to raise rates in any case?<br>
                •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then comes my recommendation and its
                defense: Should the Fed raise rates at its December
                13/14 meeting. Why?<br>
              </small></font></small>
          <blockquote><small><font size="+1"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of my defense, I should
                  explain the expected effects of a rate increase on
                  real GDP.&nbsp; Will the Fed’s actions slow growth, or
                  trigger recession?&nbsp; I need to be sure to consider
                  confounding factors: is anything raising expected
                  rates of return on investment projects? What is
                  happening to interest rates set by central banks in
                  Europe and Asia? What other factors might affect real
                  GDP?</small></font></small><br>
            <small><font size="+1"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other part of my defense (or a
                  caveat?) should be distribution. The US election
                  certainly underscored the importance of class issues,
                  which economists usually refer to as “distributional
                  issues.” I need to explicitly address how my
                  recommendation would affect workers in areas that used
                  to be centers of manufacturing.</small></font></small><br>

        <div align="left"><b>Part I.&nbsp; Questions Covering the Last
            Third of the Course (50 points total; 35 minutes total)<br>
          </b><br>
          Question 1 (14 points total; 10 minutes total)&nbsp; This
          question is based on article #21, "How Powerful are Fiscal
          Multipliers in Recessions?" by UC Berkeley Professors Alan
          Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko.<br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) According to the article by
          Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (A&amp;G), during what part of the
          business cycle is the government spending multiplier
          relatively large?&nbsp; When is it relatively small?<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
          (A&amp;G) estimate that the multiplier was about 0 in the
          early 1960s.&nbsp; If the economy is on the PPF, why would an
          increase in G have no effect on GDP?&nbsp; How is the rate of
          long-run GDP growth relevant to your answer?&nbsp; Draw a PPF
          that supports your explanation.<br>
          <br>
          Question 2 (12 points total; 8 minutes total) The Phillips
          curve has a downward slope because, ceteris paribus, there is
          a tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.<br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points)&nbsp; Why is a drop in
          unemployment associated with a rise in the inflation rate?<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points)&nbsp; Offer and defend one
          explanation for why the Phillips curve may be flatter today
          than it was twenty years ago.<br>
          <br>
          Question 3 (10 points; 7 minutes)&nbsp; Japan's economy has
          been in or near recession for over 15 years.&nbsp; The
          interest rate controlled by Japan's central bank, the Bank of
          Japan, has been at or near the zero lower bound (ZLB) since
          1998.&nbsp; Why is expansionary fiscal policy an important
          policy tool when interest rates are at the ZLB?&nbsp; Explain
          why and how expansionary fiscal policy will affect the
          government's budget deficit.<br>
          <br>
          Question 4 (14 points total; 10 minutes total)&nbsp; The
          Taylor Rule is a simple equation that describes the connection
          between macroeconomic conditions and a central bank's interest
          rate target.&nbsp; In general the Taylor Rule is <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interest rate
          target&nbsp; = neutral interest rate&nbsp; + A*(actual -
          target inflation) + B*(actual - target GDP growth rate)<br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) What does "neutral interest
          rate" mean?<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) New Zealand (NZ) and
          Australia (AUS) each have their own central bank.&nbsp;
          Estimates of the Taylor Rule for each country, for 1992-2008,
          are (source:

          <b>Part II. Questions Covering Any Part of the Course (90
            points total; 64 minutes total)</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Question 5 (10 points; 7 minutes)&nbsp; The local electricity
          company, PG&amp;E, wants to increase its total revenue earned
          from selling electricity to residents of the Bay Area.&nbsp;
          Should PG&amp;E increase or decrease the price it charges for
          electricity?&nbsp; Explain.&nbsp; If you need to make an
          assumption in order to answer the question, do so explicitly
          and defend your assumption.<br>
          <br>
          Question 6 (18 points total; 13 minutes
          total)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose interest rates decline.&nbsp;
          <br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Explain why the decline in
          interest rates raises investment spending.&nbsp; Does your
          answer depend upon whether the business is using internal
          funds (accumulated savings) or external funds (a loan)?&nbsp;
          Explain why.<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Consider a business in a
          perfectly competitive industry that is initially at long-run
          competitive equilibrium.&nbsp; The business purchases
          additional machinery, which increases labor
          productivity.&nbsp; None of its competitors buy the
          machinery.&nbsp; Under what circumstances would you expect
          this business to now be earning abnormal profit?&nbsp; Show
          the effect in a graph of the firm that includes its short-run
          cost curves.&nbsp; Explain what you've drawn and how it
          relates to your answer to the question.<br>
          <br>
          Question 7 (25 points total; 18 minutes total) All U.S.
          consumers have a FICO score, which is a measure of the
          likelihood the individual will make regular and timely
          payments on a loan or credit card.&nbsp; The FICO score allows
          lenders to screen potential borrowers, charging higher
          interest rates or denying credit to those who have bad FICO
          scores.<br>
          Suppose hackers break into the computer system that produces
          FICO scores.&nbsp; As a result of the hack, the FICO score
          assigned to any individual is probably wrong. Lenders know the
          system has been hacked. <br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points)&nbsp; What is the likely
          effect of the hacking on consumer credit availability?&nbsp;
          Why?&nbsp; Your explanation should make reference to the
          concept of asymmetric information.<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) In general, what is the likely
          effect of the hacking on consumption spending?&nbsp; Why?<br>
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Families that can borrow or
          use credit cards don't have to cut their consumption spending
          as much following a lay-off or wage cut as do families that
          can't borrow or use credit cards.&nbsp; Consumer credit
          availability therefore probably matters more to consumption
          during a recession than it does during an expansion.&nbsp;
          Consider the effect of the FICO-system hack on real GDP.&nbsp;
          Will the effect of the hack on GDP be greater in a recession
          or in an expansion?&nbsp; Explain.&nbsp; Your explanation
          should make reference to the concepts of marginal propensity
          to consume and the multiplier.<br>
          <br>
          Question 8 (20 points total; 14 minutes total) The North
          America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented in
          1994.&nbsp; NAFTA eliminated all trade barriers between
          Canada, the U.S., and Mexico allowing for tariff-free trade
          between the three countries.&nbsp; NAFTA was and remains quite
          controversial.<br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Arguments in favor of NAFTA
          point to the gains from trade.&nbsp; What does it mean for
          there to be "gains from trade"?&nbsp; What are the conditions
          under which there will be gains from trade?&nbsp; Your answer
          should make reference to the concept of comparative advantage.<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Arguments against NAFTA point
          to the costs of trade.&nbsp; For instance, the Economic Policy
          Institute in Washington DC argues<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          [NAFTA] caused the loss of some 700,000 jobs as production
          moved to Mexico. Most of these losses came in California,
          Texas, Michigan, and other states where manufacturing is
          concentrated. To be sure, there were some job gains along the
          border in service and retail sectors resulting from increased
          trucking activity, but these gains are small in relation to
          the losses, and are in lower paying occupations.
          (http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain how increased trade could cause a
          loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs.&nbsp; What is a negative
          effect of the loss of manufacturing jobs?<br>
          <br>
          Question 9 (3 points, 2 minutes)&nbsp; <br>
          When you purchase 100 shares of stock in General Electric (a
          U.S. manufacturing company), is that investment?&nbsp;
          Explain.<br>
          <br>
          Question 10 (14 points total; 10 minutes total) Just try
          finding a place to park a car in downtown Berkeley this time
          of year.&nbsp; The price of parking is $3 per hour.&nbsp; You
          can park for 2 hours.&nbsp; If you park more than 2 hours, the
          price jumps:&nbsp; you get a $55 parking ticket.&nbsp; Before
          the holiday season, most people park for about 90 minutes and
          then move their car.<br>
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Compare high-income and
          low-income parkers.&nbsp; You can assume high-income people
          have income of more than $100 per hour, while low-income
          people earn minimum wage which is $11 per hour in Berkeley and
          $9 per hour in the rest of the Bay Area.&nbsp; Which group is
          receiving more consumer surplus from parking before the
          holiday season?&nbsp; Briefly (1-2 sentences), explain why.<br>
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9 points) Explain why the increased
          demand for parking at this time of year will result in more
          parking tickets, but only for high-income people not for
          low-income people. Supplement your answer with a graph of a
          person’s demand for parking places.&nbsp; Show separately the

          <br>
          Congratulations!&nbsp; You snagged a great job writing for one
          of the country’s best newspapers.&nbsp; Your first feature
          story is about the expected increase in interest rates that
          almost everyone expects the Fed to announce on December
          16.&nbsp; Because you are new to the paper, you want to
          impress your bosses with the breadth and depth of your
          economic knowledge and with your ability to write a clear and
          compelling article.&nbsp; Your readers are educated people who
          have only a rudimentary knowledge of economics.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You’ve sketched out your outline (below), which you’ll use to
          guide your writing.&nbsp; You’ve decided you might include
          visual representations of data where appropriate (a figure can
          be worth a thousand words), but the newspaper you write for
          doesn’t allow graphs that illustrate economic concepts.&nbsp;
          Clarity is what matters most to your readers (and thus to your
          bosses).<br>
          <br>
          Outline<br>
          <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intro paragraph.&nbsp; It’s not a mystery
          novel; I need an intro paragraph that does a good job of
          letting readers know what I’ll discuss in the article<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the stage by discussing Federal
          Reserve monetary policy in general terms.&nbsp; What are the
          Fed’s goals as they set monetary policy? What economic data
          does the Fed consider when setting interest rates?&nbsp; Why
          does the Fed want to return the federal funds rate to its
          neutral rate before the next recession begins?<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now add some context.&nbsp; Why and when
          did the Fed lower rates as far as they did, and why have they
          kept them low for so long?&nbsp; Put the Great Recession in
          historical context:&nbsp; In what ways was the 2007-2009
          downturn different from most other downturns since the
          1970s?&nbsp; How has the recovery been different from
          recoveries following previous recessions?&nbsp; <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fed will probably raise rates after
          its December 15/16 meeting. Why now?&nbsp; Why not earlier
          this year? Why not wait another year?<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fed’s inflation target is 2
          percent.&nbsp; Why aren’t they waiting until inflation
          approaches 2% before raising rates? Start by noting what’s
          actually been happening to inflation rates (best to
          distinguish here between the all-items CPI inflation and
          inflation for some of the expenditure sub-categories).&nbsp;
          Then I can draw on micro principles to explain why increased
          global competition limits the ability of firms to increase
          prices in response to changes in demand or in costs of
          production.&nbsp; <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now comes the really important part of the
          article: Explain the expected effects of a rate increase on
          aggregate demand and real GDP.&nbsp; Will the Fed’s actions
          slow growth, or trigger recession?&nbsp; I need to be sure to
          consider confounding factors: is anything raising expected
          rates of return on investment projects? What is happening to
          interest rates set by central banks in Europe and Asia?<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Occupy Movement of 2011,
          distributional issues have been of interest to a lot of
          people.&nbsp; I better take time to consider whether increased
          interest rates have differential impacts on different groups
          in the economy.<br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion paragraph: I need a concluding
          paragraph that wraps up the article and lets readers know what
          to expect in coming months<br>
