      <i>This is the second midterm from Prof. Olney's Fall 2019
        offering of Economics 1.</i> <br>
      It followed the PGE power outages of October 2019 and was titled
      "The Outage Exam." <i><br>
        The exam was written as a 50 minute exam </i><i><i>but
          administered over 80 minutes</i>.</i><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        Question 1 (15 points total; 8 minutes total)<br>
        PGE is a profit-maximizing monopoly that sells electricity in
        Northern California. The marginal cost of delivering additional
        kilo-watt hours (kwh) of electricity is low and constant over a
        very large range as depicted in the graph at the right. But
        delivering electricity to homes and businesses requires
        tremendously high fixed costs.<br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Using the graph at the right,
        show the profit maximizing quantity and price, and the amount of
        profit earned by PGE per month. In the space below, explain why
        you drew your graph as you did.<br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) The state requires PGE to
        upgrade its electrical transmission equipment, increasing PGE’s
        fixed cost. What is the effect on the profit maximizing quantity
        and price? On the amount of profit earned by PGE per month?
        Explain.<br>
        <br>
        Question 2 (18 points total; 8 minutes total)<br>
        (For Part B of this question, you should think about article
        #17, “Wealth Inequality and the Marginal Propensity to
        Consume.”) When the power went out, many people were unable to
        work and were not paid for the days the power was out. They will
        never be able to earn that income; it is simply gone. Suppose
        the lost wages in one isolated county totals $10,000,000 ($10
        million). <br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points total) Why will the total drop in
        income in that county be more than $10 million? Do not just name
        a concept here, explain the process fully and completely.<br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points total) Compare 2 communities.
        Pond County residents are almost all poor. They have no savings,
        no accumulated wealth, no access to credit. Rain County
        residents are rich. They have high levels of wealth and easy
        access to credit. In both communities, the lost wages from the
        outage total $10,000,000 ($10 million).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In which community – Pond County or Rain
        County – is the total loss of income larger? Why?<br>
        <br>
        Question 3 (20 points total; 10 minutes total)<br>
        Consider PGE’s decision to cut off power, leaving hundreds of
        thousands of customers without power for hours or days. From
        PGE’s perspective, the marginal cost of cutting power is the
        lost revenue – customers who didn’t receive electricity during
        the outage will have lower electrical bills next month. From
        PGE’s perspective, the marginal benefit of cutting power is the
        fires that therefore didn’t start and resulting financial
        responsibility and lawsuits avoided. The graph at the right
        captures PGE’s marginal cost and benefit.<br>
        <br>
        Cutting off power generates negative externalities for PGE
        customers in the form of lost wages, food and medications that
        spoil and must be discarded, cost of batteries and generator
        fuel, the emotional stress, and more.<br>
        <br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) In the top graph at the right,
        show the effect of the negative externalities. Label the
        socially optimal quantity of customers without power, QSOC.
        Label the privately (PGE) optimal quantity of customers without
        power, QPGE. <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) The state forces PGE to give
        $100 to each customer who lost power. In the lower graph at the
        right, show the effect of this penalty on PGE’s optimal quantity
        of customers without power. <br>
        C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) What information do we need in
        order to determine if $100 per customer is the optimal penalty?
        <br>
        D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Under what circumstances would
        the socially optimal quantity of customers without power be 0?<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (4 points; 2 minutes)<br>
        Where would the following activity be recorded in the US GDP
        expenditure accounts? Be sure to indicate both the category ( C
        I G EX IM or not recorded) and the $ amount.<br>
        UCB spends $100,000 on a new Zoom Pro site license to enable
        classes and office hours to be conducted during a power outage.
        Zoom Pro pays coders in India $5,000 to do whatever it is coders
        do to make this thing work.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (15 points total; 8 minutes total)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
        Suppose the economy can be described by the following equations
        (all values are billions of dollars per month):<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C = 100 +
        0.8YD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EX =
        500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TR = 1,000<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = 300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IM = 300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TA = 1,500<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G = 400<br>
        What is the equilibrium level of output and income?&nbsp; Show
        all your work or you will receive zero (0) points on this
        question.&nbsp; If you cannot solve this problem without a
        calculator, set it up and go as far as you can to receive as
        much partial credit as possible.&nbsp; No calculators allowed
        during the exam. Put a box around your final answer.<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (12 points total; 6 minutes total)<br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) What is the distinction between
        nominal GDP and real GDP? <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) If nominal GDP rises, does
        employment necessarily rise? Explain.<br>
        C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) In 2009 in the worst of the
        Great Recession, annual real GDP in the US was $15 trillion and
        potential GDP was $16 trillion. How big was the output gap?<br>
        <br>
        Question 7 (16 points total; 8 minutes total)<br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Who does investment spending:
        households, businesses, or governments? What are the three types
        of spending included in investment spending (I)? <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) In our standard model of
        investment spending, a decrease in interest rates ceteris
        paribus will increase spending on investment. Explain why.<br>
        C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) PGE predicts fire-season power
        outages will recur for a decade. The PGE power outages are
        contributing to heightened uncertainty about the future for
        California businessowners. Why might heightened uncertainty lead
        to a decrease in investment spending?<br>

      <i>This is the second midterm from Prof. Olney's Fall 2018
        offering of Economics 1.</i>&nbsp; <i><br>
        The exam was written as a 50 minute exam </i><i><i>but
          administered over 80 minutes</i>.<br>
        <br>
      </i>
      <div align="left">Question 1 (15 points total; 8 minutes total) <br>
        One contributor to climate change is driving gas-powered
        vehicles. Economic analysts have estimated that the marginal
        damage cost associated with the use of gas equals $3.80 per
        gallon. California’s gas tax is currently 38 cents per gallon. <br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) At the right, draw two graphs.
        One should depict the effect of the externality and show both
        the private and socially optimal quantities of gas. The other
        graph should depict the market for gas and show the market both
        without any taxes imposed and with the California 38 cent tax
        imposed.<br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) If Proposition 6 on California’s
        ballot in today’s election passes, California’s gas tax will be
        decreased from 38 cents to 26 cents per gallon. Will passage of
        Prop. 6 move California closer to selling the socially optimal
        quantity of gas? Explain. <br>
        <br>
        Question 2 (10 points total; 5 minutes total) <br>
        Suppose that the mpc increases as income declines. As a result,
        people who make $2 million per year have a relatively low mpc
        but people who make $60,000 per year have a relatively high mpc.
        Compare two economies.<br>
        <blockquote>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economy A has the 1980 US income
          distribution <br>
          •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economy B has today’s US income
          distribution<br>
        </blockquote>
        The government gives everyone a check (a transfer payment) equal
        to 10% of their usual income. In which economy – Economy A or
        Economy B – would these checks have a greater effect on
        consumption? Explain. Start your explanation by stating the
        difference between the 1980 &amp; current US income
        distributions, based on the article #13a, “Striking it Richer:
        The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States,” by Emmanuel
        Saez.<br>
        <br>
        Question 3 (15 points, 8 minutes total) <br>
        Billz Coffee is a local profit-maximizing coffee shop operating
        in a monopolistically competitive industry. Billz is initially
        in long-run equilibrium. But then the building owner where Billz
        operates its coffee shop increases Billz rent from $5,000 to
        $8,000 per month.<br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) At the right, draw the graph
        showing the initial long-run equilibrium position for Billz,
        labeling everything with subscripts “1.” Then show the effect of
        the increase in rent, labeling everything with subscripts “2.”<br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Billz pays rent to a landlord
        for its storefront. When the landlord increases Billz rent from
        $5,000 to $8,000 per month. What is the short run effect on
        Billz prices, quantity sold, and profit? In the long run, what
        will Billz do? What is the effect on prices charged by other
        coffee shops in the area? Defend your answers.<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (15 points) <br>
        Suppose the economy can be described by the following equations
        (all values are billions of dollars per year)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C = 1500 +
        0.8YD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G =

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IM = 1500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TA = 1500<br>
        What is the equilibrium level of output and income?&nbsp; Show
        all your work or you will receive zero (0) points on this
        question.&nbsp; If you cannot solve this problem without a
        calculator, set it up and go as far as you can to receive as
        much partial credit as possible.&nbsp; No calculators allowed
        during the exam.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (30 points total; 18 minutes total)&nbsp; <br>
        For reasons we will explore later in November, the Federal
        Reserve (Fed) can change interest rates. For now, don’t worry
        about how or why they change interest rates.<br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Suppose that the Fed increases
        interest rates. At the same time, businesspeople become
        pessimistic about the future and decrease their estimates of
        future sales. What is the effect of these two events on
        investment spending? Explain. <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points) The Fed increases interest
        rates. No other country increases its interest rates. Does the
        US dollar rise or fall vis a vis other currencies? What is the
        effect on exports? On imports? Explain the process by which
        these effects occur. Be complete.<br>
        C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Compare two countries. <br>
        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Country O: A
          large share of the spending of residents of country O is for
          imported goods and services. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Country C:&nbsp;
          Because of high tariffs, very little of the spending of
          residents of country C is for imported goods and services. <br>
        </blockquote>
        In which country – country O or country C – will a recession
        caused by an increase in interest rates be more severe?
        Carefully explain your answer.<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (7 points; 4 minutes) <br>
        Write a paragraph that summarizes the current state of the U.S.
        economy.<br>
        <br>
        Question 7 (8 points; 4 minutes) <br>
        This question is based on article #15, “5 Ways GDP Gets it
        Totally Wrong as a Measure of our Success” by David Pilling.
        What is the definition of gross domestic product (GDP)? What
        does it mean to say “GDP is a measure of income, not of wealth”?
        Cite and discuss one of the five ways the author cites as a
        problem with using GDP as the sole indicator of economic
        conditions.<br>

        <br>
        Question 3 (20 points total; 10 minutes total)<br>
        Part b of this question is based on two articles:<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #10b, “Economic Growth in the United States:
        A Tale of Two Countries,” by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and
        Gabriel Zucman. Washington Center for Equitable Growth blog,
        December 6, 2016. <br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;#18, “Wealth Inequality and the
        Marginal Propensity to Consume,” by Nick Bunker, Washington
        Center for Equitable Growth, December 17, 2014. <br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) A cut in taxes boosts
        disposable income, leading households to increase consumer
        spending. Explain why the total increase in GDP should be larger
        than the initial increase in consumer spending triggered by a
        tax cut.&nbsp; Be clear and be complete.&nbsp; Simply mentioning
        the name of a concept is insufficient.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Suppose that the top 1 percent
        income earners studied in the work by Piketty, Saez, and Zucman
        (shorthand “PSZ,” #10b) have much greater wealth than the bottom
        50 percent studied by PSZ.&nbsp; Over the period 1962-2014, what
        were the patterns of the share of income accruing to the bottom
        50 percent and the top 1 percent of income earners? Based on the
        findings in the Bunker article (#18), what is the effect of
        those patterns shown in PSZ on the size of the multiplier over
        the period 1962-2014? Explain your answer. (Your answer should
        make it clear that you read the articles.)<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (25 points total; 13 minutes total) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspired by
https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/10/30/is-a-hollywood-tax-credit-still-needed-to-protect-industry-jobs/<br>
        Consider the activity “filming a movie or TV series.” Hollywood
        film studios employ a large number of people when they make a
        movie or shoot a television series. Although the studios have
        their headquarters in Hollywood, CA, they can choose where to do
        the filming – in California or elsewhere.&nbsp; Starting in
        2014, the state of California offered large subsidies to film
        studios that chose to do their filming in California rather than
        elsewhere.<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Give and defend one example of a
        positive externality associated with filming a movie or TV
        series in California.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Is filming a movie or TV series
        a situation in which the Coase Theorem applies?&nbsp; Defend
        your answer.<br>
        C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points)&nbsp; California pays subsidies
        of $330 million annually to Hollywood film studios who choose to
        film in California. Draw graphs that illustrate the positive
        externality associated with filming in California and,
        separately, the effect of the subsidy. The quantity is the
        number of movies or TV episodes filmed in CA per year. <br>
        D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) State legislators have to decide
        soon whether to extend the subsidy program beyond its expiration
        in 2020. What do they need to know in order to determine if the
        subsidy is the optimal size? Explain.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (16 points; 8 minutes)<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Why does a decrease in interest
        rates typically lead to an increase in investment spending? In
        your answer, be sure to distinguish between the interest rate(s)
        that are relevant for firms using internal finance versus the
        interest rate(s) that are relevant for firms using external
        finance.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) The expected rate of return on a
        potential investment project is 2 percent. That 2 percent is a
        mean (or, average) of a distribution of possible returns ranging
        from -1 to +3 percent. If the business owners are loss averse,
        will a drop in interest rates from 2.5 to 1.5 percent
        necessarily lead to an increase in investment spending? Explain
        your answer. (Your explanation should make it clear to your GSI
        that you know what it means to be “loss averse.”)<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (12 points total; 6 minutes total)<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) At the right, draw a graph that
        shows a monopolistically competitive firm in long run
        equilibrium.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) For a monopoly, profit can be
        greater than zero in the long run. Explain why profit is equal
        to zero in the long run for a monopolistically competitive firm
        but not for a monopolist.<br>

        Question 3 (17 points total; 9 minutes total)<br>
        During World War II, the U.S. federal government increased its
        purchases of good and services from $6.5 billion in 1940 to
        almost $100 billion in 1944. GDP in 1940 was $101 billion, so
        you can see what an enormous increase in G this was.<br>
        a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Explain why the total increase
        in GDP should be larger than the initial increase in government
        spending.&nbsp; Be clear and be complete.&nbsp; Simply
        mentioning the name of a concept is insufficient.<br>
        b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) During World War II, U.S.
        consumers faced “consumer rationing.”&nbsp; Consumers were not
        allowed to purchase cars and appliances. Consumers could
        purchase other items such as sugar, flour, and meat, only in
        limited amounts. Explain why the change in GDP from each
        additional $1 billion in government spending is smaller when
        there is rationing during World War II than when there is no
        rationing after the war.<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (20 points total; 10 minutes total) <br>
        An oil or gas pipeline laid across land creates the risk of
        environmental damage from leaks or explosion and fire (such as
        the explosion in Alabama on October 31). A large private oil
        company wants to construct a pipeline across land in the upper
        midwest of the United States. Thousands of people who live near
        the proposed pipeline are opposed to its construction and want
        construction stopped.<br>
        a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points)&nbsp; Is this a situation in
        which the Coase Theorem applies?&nbsp; Why or why not?<br>
        b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (14 points) Two proposals have been offered
        to address the concerns of people opposed to the pipeline
        construction.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposal 1: Make the oil
        company pay a penalty now to offset the expected costs of future
        leaks or other environmental damage<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposal 2: Stop
        construction of the pipeline<br>
        <br>
        Under what conditions would proposal 1 generate the socially
        optimal quantity of pipeline construction? Is there a situation
        in which proposal 2 would generate the socially optimal quantity
        of pipeline construction?&nbsp; Explain your answers.&nbsp; Draw
        a graph at the right that demonstrates a situation in which
        proposal 2 is optimal.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (10 points; 5 minutes)<br>
        Under the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare),
        everyone is required to do one of two things:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have health insurance
        coverage<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay a penalty for not
        being insured.&nbsp; The minimum penalty for 2017 is $695<br>
        The population can be divided into two groups of people: [1]
        healthy people under the age of 30 and [2] everyone else,
        including the unhealthy people.&nbsp; If healthy people under
        the age of 30 choose to pay the penalty rather than buy
        insurance, use asymmetric information concepts to explain what
        will happen in health insurance markets over time.<br>

        Bill Gates, Project Syndicate, May 6, 2013, discuss why
        household surveys would provide better information than official
        GDP statistics for policy makers working in very poor countries.<br>

        Question 3 (10 points; 4 minutes) <br>
        Many economists think the U.S. economy is at full employment
        whenever the unemployment rate is 5 percent or lower.&nbsp; The
        unemployment rate for October 2015, announced Friday morning,
        was 5.0 percent. <br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Are we in an “unemployment
        equilibrium”? Explain.<br>
        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Referring to article #16
        (“Yellen's Philosophy: The More Jobs Data, the Better”), what
        are 2 other items of jobs data you could gather to determine
        whether the U.S. economy is on or inside of its production
        possibilities frontier (PPF)?&nbsp; For each item, what
        information does it provide about the economy?<br>

        Question 4 (10 points, 4 minutes) <br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points)&nbsp; Why can’t monopolistically
        competitive firms earn economic profit in the long run?&nbsp; <br>
        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points)&nbsp; Why is the adjustment to
        long run equilibrium shown as a shift of demand in monopolistic
        competition but as a shift of supply in perfect competition?<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (35 points; 16 minutes) In Fall 2008, interest rates
        in the U.S. were decreased.<br>
        a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) How should investment spending
        have reacted to the Fall 2008 drop in interest rates?&nbsp;
        Explain why.<br>
        b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) In Fall 2008, the economy was
        collapsing rapidly and most people were surprised and
        confused.&nbsp; Business uncertainty rose dramatically.&nbsp;
        With reference to article #20 in the reader (“Holding on for
        Tomorrow: How Economic Uncertainty Dulls Investment,” explain
        why a rise in uncertainty affects investment spending.<br>
        c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points) Assuming only U.S. interest
        rates were decreased in Fall 2008, how should net exports (EX -
        IM) have reacted to the drop in interest rates?&nbsp; Explain
        why.<br>
        d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Explain why the total change in
        real GDP would be larger than the initial change in investment +
        the initial change in net exports.<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (10 points; 4 minutes)<br>
        According to the study by Chris Carroll et al cited in article
        #17a by Nick Bunker (“Wealth Inequality and the Marginal
        Propensity to Consume”) middle-income families have a larger mpc
        than do wealth families.&nbsp; In which case below would the
        multiplier be larger? Explain why.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Today) When the wealthy
        owners of consumer goods companies are paid 300 times as much as
        the typical worker in their companies, as is true today, or <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (50 years ago) When the
        wealthy owners of consumer goods companies are paid 20 times as
        much as the typical worker in their companies, as was true fifty
        years ago&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Question 7 (15 points, 7 minutes) <br>
        San Franciscans who work at tech companies such as Google and
        Apple can ride to work for free on “tech shuttles” – large
        luxury busses that seat 120 people.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fans of the shuttles note
        that each 120-seat bus represents 120 fewer cars commuting on
        the freeways, decreasing pollution and traffic<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opponents of the shuttles
        argue that the large busses allow tech workers to live far from
        the office, promoting gentrification.<br>
        Tech companies pay the entire cost of providing the
        shuttle.&nbsp; In addition, they also pay San Francisco a fee to
        operate in The City.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Instead of being charged fees, should the tech shuttles be
        subsidized by local government?&nbsp; Defend your answer, using
        economic language.&nbsp; State any necessary assumptions
        explicitly.&nbsp; Draw graph(s) as appropriate.<br>
