      <i>This is the first midterm from Prof. Olney's Fall 2019 offering
        of Economics 1.</i>&nbsp; <i><br>
        The exam was written as a 50 minute</i><i> exam but administered
        over 80 minutes.</i>
      <div align="left"><br>
        Question 1 (10 points; 5 minutes)<br>
        When a neighborhood (such as the Mission in San Francisco)
        gentrifies, two things happen. [1] The incomes of people who
        live in a neighborhood rise sharply. [2] The rents that shops
        and restaurants pay also rise sharply. What effect does
        gentrification of a neighborhood have on prices and quantities
        of restaurant meals?&nbsp; In the space below, answer the
        question &amp; defend your answer. Draw a graph that supports
        your answer.<br>
        <br>
        Question 2 (8 points; 4 minutes)<br>
        In an effort to address rising rents, the City of Oakland
        changed its policies about 10 years ago to encourage more
        construction. The Uptown area of Oakland has seen a big increase
        in the number of apartment and condo buildings since the policy
        was changed. But over the same decade, rents in Oakland and in
        the Uptown area of Oakland have increased, a lot.&nbsp; Critics
        of the city say the increase in rent indicates the policy change
        failed to address rising rents. Supporters of the city say the
        critics have not formed the right counterfactual. Explain to the
        critics what “the right counterfactual” would be and why their
        criticism is ill-formed.<br>
        <br>
        Question 3 (8 points; 4 minutes)<br>
        A tariff is simply a tax. In the case of a tariff, the tax is
        assessed on purchases of imported goods. Suppose a new tariff of
        10 percent is imposed on imported goods. Suppose before the
        tariff, imports were $300 billion per year. If the tariff
        generates about $28 billion of tariff (tax) revenue per year for
        the government, what can you say about the tariff’s
        effectiveness in lowering quantity demanded? Draw a graph that
        supports your answer.<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (10 points; 5 minutes)<br>
        This question is from reader article #8, “Bart Fare Increase
        Isn’t a Done Deal,” by Rachel Swan, San Francisco Chronicle,
        June 4, 2019. Based on the three factors that affect price
        elasticity of demand, what would you argue are the likely
        short-run and long-run effects of an increase in Bart fares? The
        Bart Board’s goal is to maximize total revenue. In what case(s)
        should the Bart increase fares?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Washington DC Metro system is very
        similar to Bart, but it has higher “peak” (commute time) and
        lower “off-peak” (mid-day, evenings, weekend) fares. If Bart
        implemented a similar peak versus off-peak fare system, how
        would having “peak” and “off-peak” times and fares impact your
        analysis? <br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (10 points; 5 minutes)<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2 points) Suppose a city imposes rent
        control. In the graph at the right, p* is the market equilibrium
        monthly rent for a 1-bedroom apartment and pc is the rent
        controlled price. Using the graph, how many apartments will be
        rented per month at the rent-controlled price? <br>
        B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 points) What is the definition of
        consumer surplus?<br>
        C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 points) Suppose landlords ask for credit
        reports and rent (at the rent-controlled price PC) to the people
        with the highest willingness and ability to pay. On the graph,
        shade in the amount of consumer surplus that would be generated
        using vertical lines ||| to shade in the area. Briefly explain
        why you shaded it as you did.<br>
        D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Suppose instead the apartments
        are rented at the rent-controlled price PC to the people with
        the lowest willingness and ability to pay. On the graph, shade
        in the amount of consumer surplus that would be generated using
        horizontal lines &#8801; to shade in the area. Briefly explain why you
        shaded it as you did.<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (30 points total; 15 minutes total)<br>
        Consider the market for milk produced by dairy farmers in
        Wisconsin. The milk produced in Wisconsin is sold in both the US
        and Asia. Treat that as one market (the market for milk produced
        in Wisconsin). Assume the Wisconsin milk market is perfectly
        competitive, the dairy farmers are profit maximizers, and the
        market was initially in long-run competitive equilibrium. <br>
        A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Draw the graphs below for the
        milk market and the typical Wisconsin dairy farmer, showing the
        initial long run competitive equilibrium. Use subscripts "1" on
        your labels. <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) As a result of the trade war,
        Asian demand for Wisconsin milk has decreased. Show the effects
        on your graph above, using subscripts “S” or “SR” or “2" on your
        labels. (Help yourself and your GSI by using a different color
        or dashes for your curves in this part.) Summarize your graph by
        noting below the SHORT RUN effect (increase, decrease, no
        change) of the drop in demand on the price of milk, on the
        typical quantity of milk sold by an individual Wisconsin dairy
        farmer, on the typical profit of a Wisconsin dairy farmer, and
        on the market quantity of milk sold by Wisconsin dairy farmers.
        For each answer, provide a one sentence defense.<br>
        C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Now show the LONG RUN effects on
        your graph above, using subscripts “L” or “LR” or “3" on your
        labels. Relative to the effects in part b, what are the LONG RUN
        effects of the drop in Asian demand on price, quantity of milk
        sold by a typical Wisconsin dairy farmer, profit of a typical
        Wisconsin dairy farmer, the number of Wisconsin dairy farmers,
        and market quantity of milk sold by Wisconsin dairy farmers? For
        each answer, provide a one sentence defense. <br>
        D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Thinking about dairy farming,
        what is the difference between “exiting” the industry and
        “shutting down”? Under what circumstances would a dairy farmer
        shut down? <br>
        <br>
        Question 7 (24 points total; 12 minutes total)<br>
        There are two products that can be produced in the economy:
        shelter and high tech. “Shelter” includes any place you can
        live: houses or apartments, owner-occupied or rented. “High
        tech” includes all the products we associate with Silicon Valley
        – high tech, internet, social media, and so on. Land can be used
        to produce shelter, or it can be used to produce high tech. But
        any particular parcel of land can not be used to produce both
        shelter and high tech.<br>
        <br>
        There are two areas in the economy: the Central Valley (CV) and
        the Silicon Valley (SV). The Central Valley (CV) has the
        comparative advantage in the production of shelter. The Silicon
        Valley has the comparative advantage in the production of high
        tech.<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Draw a production possibilities
        frontier for the CV. Label your axes. In the space below,
        explain why a PPF is usually non-linear. Note: Simply writing
        down the name of a concept is not what it means to "explain"
        something.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Who has the lower opportunity
        cost of producing shelter, CV or SV? In general (so, you need
        not know anything about CV or SV to answer), what might give one
        area a lower opportunity cost of producing shelter? Explain.<br>
        C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) If CV and SV decide to
        specialize and trade, which area will produce shelter? Which
        area will produce high tech? What does it mean to say there will
        be “gains from trade”?<br>
        D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) It takes about two hours to
        commute from CV to SV. Do you think it is good for CV and SV to
        specialize and trade? Why or why not?<br>

      <div align="left">Question 1 (16 points total; 8 minutes total)
        Chris and Robin are a married couple. They both use pronouns
        “they/them/theirs.” Both Chris and Robin are able to produce two
        goods: home production (meals, laundry, housekeeping, child
        raising) and market production (working for a wage). <br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Suppose Chris and Robin wish to
        maximize the total quantity of home production and market
        production that they can collectively produce. They are
        considering specializing (one person focuses on home production,
        the other on market production) and trading (sharing with each
        other). What is one condition under which specialization and
        trade will NOT increase total production for this couple? Defend
        your answer.<br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Consider Chris-and-Robin
        (C&amp;R) as one economy, producing two goods: home production
        and market production. Draw a PPF for the C&amp;R economy,
        placing home production on the vertical axis and market
        production on the horizontal axis. Label this PPF as PPF1. <br>
        <br>
        Chris-and-Robin have a new baby! They have not had a full
        night’s sleep since the baby was born. The lack of sleep has
        decreased their productivity, a lot. Show the effect of the lack
        of sleep on the PPF, using label PPF2. Explain why you drew
        PPF2&nbsp; as you did.<br>
        C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Hooray for Mom! Mom (grandma!)
        arrives for a four-week visit to help with home production.
        Explain why Mom’s visit allows C&amp;R to increase their
        consumption of home and market production beyond the PPF you
        drew in part b. (No graph required in part c.)<br>
        <br>
        Question 2 (9 points; 4.5 minutes)&nbsp; What are “marginal

        Consider the graph at the right. Are both X and Y
        profit-maximizing quantities? Defend your answer.<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (10 points; 5 minutes) <br>
        Consider wine produced from grapes grown in California
        (“California wine”). Some California wine is sold primarily in
        China. Other California wine is sold primarily in the United
        States. As of last Sunday, China charges a 79 % tariff (tax) on
        California wine sold in China. <br>
        <br>
        In the short run, what effects do you expect the new Chinese
        tariff on California wine will have on the market equilibrium
        price and market equilibrium quantity of California wine sold in
        the United States? Explain why. Supplement your answer with a
        graph of the market for California wine sold in the U.S.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (16 points total; 8 minutes total) This question
        relies on article #6a, “In Praise of Price Gouging,” by John
        Stossel (September 7, 2005). <br>
        <br>
        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( 8 points) Stossel begins with a
        (hypothetical) story of someone paying $20 for a bottle of
        water. Use a supply and demand graph to illustrate how the
        equilibrium price of a bottle of water might have risen,
        post-Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, from $1 to $20 a bottle.
        Use subscripts “1" for the pre-hurricane period and subscripts
        “2" for the post-hurricane period.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Now suppose New Orleans has an anti-price-gouging law in place,
        preventing price of water from rising above $2 per bottle after
        a natural disaster. Show the effects of the anti-price-gouging
        law on your graph using subscripts “3.” <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Explain why you showed the
        effect of the anti-price-gouging law as you did.<br>
        C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) Laws against price gouging in
        the wake of a natural disaster might create a market
        disequilibrium. What is a non-price mechanism that could be used
        to allocate bottles of water following a hurricane? Will your
        non-price mechanism ensure that water goes to the people who
        really need it? Explain.<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (9 points, 4.5 minutes) You work for a grocer who
        accidentally bought an extra 1,000 pounds of onions. The grocer
        has paid the onion farmer and can not return the extra onions.
        The goal now is to maximize revenue from selling onions. The
        usual price for onions is 59 cents per pound. Should the grocer
        increase the price above 59 cents, or lower the price below 59
        cents in order to maximize revenue? Defend your answer. If you
        need to make any assumptions, do so explicitly (that is, write
        the assumption(s) down, don’t just keep them locked in your
        brain).<br>
        <br>
        Question 7 (32 points total; 16 minutes total) Consider the U.S.
        market for plastic toys manufactured in China. The toys are sold
        in U.S. stores (“the sellers”) and bought by U.S. consumers
        (“the buyers”).&nbsp; Assume this market is perfectly
        competitive.<br>
        A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Draw the graphs below for the
        U.S. market and the typical U.S. seller of Chinese-manufactured
        plastic toys, showing the initial long run competitive
        equilibrium. Use subscripts "1" on your labels. <br>
        B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) The United States government
        imposes a tariff (tax) on Chinese manufactured toys. Assume the
        tariff is a constant dollar amount per toy and is remitted to
        the government by the U.S. seller. Show the effects on your
        graph above, using subscripts “S” or “SR” on your labels. (Help
        yourself and your GSI by using a different color or dashes for
        your curves in this part.) Summarize your graph by noting the
        SHORT RUN effect of the new tariff (increase, decrease, no
        change) on the price of Chinese-manufactured toys sold in the
        U.S., on the typical number of Chinese-manufactured toys sold by
        a U.S. seller, on the typical profit of a seller, and on the
        market quantity of Chinese-manufactured toys sold in the U.S.

        <br>
        Question 2 (10 points; 5 minutes) This question is based on
        article #8, "How Chicken Wings Explain Metro's Looming Ridership
        Problems," by Powers (2017). The Metro in DC is very similar to
        our Bart system, with the fare dependent upon the distance
        traveled.&nbsp; The one difference between the two systems is
        that the Metro charges higher fares during commute time than it
        does during "off-peak" time.<br>
        <br>
        Based on the factors that affect price elasticity of demand,
        what are the likely short-run and long-run effects on total
        revenue of an increase in DC Metro fares?&nbsp; In your answer,
        distinguish between the effects of increasing fares during
        commute time and during "off-peak" times. <br>
        <br>
        Question 3 (25 points; 13 minutes)&nbsp; The U.S. Virgin Islands
        (USVI) is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean. It produces two
        outputs: tourism and rum. Rum can be made from sugarcane, which
        grows in the islands.<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) Draw a PPF for USVI, putting
        tourism on the vertical axis and rum on the horizontal
        axis.&nbsp; Label your PPF as "PPF1." Explain why you drew your
        PPF with that particular slope and shape.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) USVI acquires new seaports that
        accommodate large cruise ships carrying thousands of tourists.
        What effect do the new ports have on USVI's PPF?&nbsp; Why? Show
        the effect on your graph, using labels with subscripts "2."<br>
        C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) USVI pursues the gains from
        trade.&nbsp; USVI trades with the mainland. Rum can be
        manufactured anywhere. USVI has the comparative advantage in
        tourism. For many years, demand for tourism is quite high and
        USVI is operating on its PPF.&nbsp; On your PPF drawn above,
        draw in a point and label it "C" to indicate where USVI
        produces. Below, defend your choice.<br>
        D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Hurricanes Irma and Maria
        destroyed the beautiful sandy beaches and beachfront properties
        that drew many tourists to USVI. Tourists stop coming to USVI.
        Without outside aid, can USVI quickly go back to the standard of
        living it had before the hurricanes? Would your answer be
        different if USVI had not pursued the gains from trade?&nbsp;
        Explain your answers.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Question 4 (19 points; 10 minutes)<br>
        You are an economist who is asked by the UCB administration to
        analyze whether the $800,000 security expenditure on Sunday
        September 24 was a good idea. You tell the administration you
        first need to know three things<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their goal<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the counterfactual<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the opportunity cost of
        the funds<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Separately for each of these
        three items, explain why you need that piece of information (the
        goal, the counterfactual, the opportunity cost) in order to
        provide your analysis.<br>
        B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9 points) Think about the four causes of
        disagreement discussed in article #1 by Fritz Machlup, "Why
        Economists Disagree," published in 1965.&nbsp; For each of these
        3 items (goal, counterfactual, opportunity cost), what is a
        possible cause of disagreement? Defend your answers.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (28 points; 14 minutes) <br>
        Consider the market facilitated by Airbnb: the market for
        renting rooms by the night&nbsp; in houses and apartments<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sellers are called
        "hosts." They offer a room for rent. Hosts can be homeowners or
        apartment leaseholders.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers are called
        "guests." They pay hosts in order to rent a room for 1 night or
        more in a house or apartment<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is the nightly
        rent. The quantity in the market is “room-nights” which is the
        sum of the number of nights each room is rented, summed over all
        hosts.<br>
        A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 points) If the typical economic profit
        earned by a host is 0, will anyone want to be a host? Explain.<br>
        B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Assume the market for rented
        rooms is perfectly competitive and is initially in long run
        competitive equilibrium.&nbsp; Draw the relevant graphs below
        for the market and for the typical host.&nbsp; Use subscripts
        "1" on your labels. <br>
        C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) There is a change: The City of
        San Francisco now requires all Airbnb hosts to pay a $125 fee to
        the City each year. The fee must be paid regardless of the
        number of room-nights sold.&nbsp; What is the SHORT RUN effect
        of the new city fee on the price of a rented room in a house or
        apartment? On the typical number of room-nights sold by a host?
        On the typical profit of a host? On the market quantity of
        room-nights sold? For each answer (increase, decrease, no
        change), provide a one sentence defense. Show the effects on
        your graph above, using subscripts "2" on your labels. (Help
        yourself and your GSI by using a different color or dashes for
        your curves in this part.)<br>
        D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Relative to the short run
        effects in part c, what are the LONG RUN effects of the new city
        fee on price, room-nights sold by a typical host, profit of a
        typical host, the number of hosts, and market quantity of room
        nights sold? For each answer (increase, decrease, no change),
        provide a one sentence defense.&nbsp; Show the effects on your
        graph above, using subscripts "3" on your labels.<br>

          administered over 80 minutes</i>.</i><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Question 1 (22 points, 11 minutes) Let's
        consider two parts of California as two separate economies: the
        Central Valley and Silicon Valley.&nbsp; Suppose these economies
        produce two products: agricultural products and industrial
        products (including high tech and aerospace).&nbsp; <br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Initially the two economies each
        produce a mix of both goods: agricultural products (A) and
        industrial products (I).&nbsp; Illustrate the production
        possibilities of the Central Valley economy.&nbsp; Explain why
        the PPF has the shape it does. <br>
        b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) The Central Valley has fertile
        land and extensive irrigation systems delivering water to
        farms.&nbsp; When the irrigation system was installed, it vastly
        increased agricultural productivity.&nbsp; The Silicon Valley is
        near two major universities whose graduates are some of the best
        tech and data scientists in the country.&nbsp; The tech and data
        scientists are constantly inventing new products and more
        efficient ways to produce high tech and aerospace goods.<br>
        <br>
        Over time everyone recognizes that the Central Valley has a
        comparative advantage in the production of agricultural
        products. Explain why the many fruit trees that once grew in the
        Silicon Valley no longer exist.<br>
        c.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 points) Which economy -- Central
        Valley or Silicon Valley -- will grow faster over time?&nbsp;
        Defend your answer.<br>
        <br>
        Question 2 (10 points, 5 minutes)&nbsp; One candidate says: “The
        crime rate fell after a particular policing policy was
        implemented, which is evidence that the policing policy was
        successful.”&nbsp; The other candidate says: “Wrong.”&nbsp; What
        is a proper way to evaluate whether the policy was successful?<br>
        <br>
        Question 3 (10 points, 5 minutes) Drawing on the article #5,
        “How Scalpers Make Their Millions with ‘Hamilton’,” sketch a
        model of supply and demand that shows why the price of scalped
        tickets for the July 9 performance was so much greater than it
        had been in May. Identify the forces that shifted demand and
        those that shifted supply.&nbsp; In your answer, include enough
        detail from the article that we know you read the article. (If
        you didn’t read the article and you try to make stuff up, you’ll
        earn fewer points than if you are honest and say “I didn’t read
        it.”)<br>
        <br>
        Question 4 (36 points, 18 minutes) Suppose that pizza is sold in
        a perfectly competitive market<br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Initially, the pizza industry is
        in long-run competitive equilibrium.&nbsp; Draw the relevant
        graphs below for the market and for the typical firm.&nbsp; Use
        subscripts “1” on your labels. <br>
        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) A new tax on pizza is
        implemented: $2 per pizza that must be paid to the city. In the
        short run, what happens to the price of pizza?&nbsp; To the
        market quantity?&nbsp; To the quantity produced by the typical
        firm?&nbsp; To the profit of the typical firm?&nbsp; Show the
        effects on your graph above, using subscripts “2” on your
        labels. (Help yourself and your GSI by using a different color
        or dashes for your curves in this part.)<br>
        c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) In the short run, who will bear
        the greater burden of the tax: buyers or sellers?&nbsp; Defend
        your answer.<br>
        d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) In the long run, what happens in
        the pizza industry?&nbsp; Specify the effects on market price,
        market quantity, typical firm quantity, typical firm profit, and
        the number of firms.&nbsp; Show the effects on your graph above,
        using subscripts “3” on your labels.<br>
        <br>
        Question 5 (10 points, 5 minutes)&nbsp; Suppose that sellers
        could determine every individual buyer's willingness &amp;
        ability to pay for a product, and then charged each individual
        that price.&nbsp; If you're willing and able to pay $10, you're
        charged $10.&nbsp; If I'm willing and able to pay $2.25, I'm
        charged $2.25.&nbsp; What can you say about the total consumer
        surplus in that market?<br>
        <br>
        Question 6 (12 points, 6 minutes)&nbsp; Compare two
        manufacturing firms.&nbsp; One, Spacious Firm (SF) has a 10,000
        square foot building with lots of machines. The machines are
        arranged efficiently so that when additional workers are brought
        into Spacious Firm, the workers can start producing output right
        away.&nbsp; The other, Crowded Firm (CF) has a 2,000 square foot
        building with the same number of machines as Spacious
        Firm.&nbsp; The machines are crowded onto the factory floor in a
        haphazard way.&nbsp; When additional workers are brought into
        Crowded Firm, all workers are bumping into each other and the
        total output of Crowded Firm only rises a small amount.<br>

        Label each of the marginal cost curves below with a label – SF
        or CF – to indicate which MC curve best describes which
        firm.&nbsp; Explain your answer.&nbsp; Your explanation should

      <hr style="width: 60%; height: 2px;"><i>This is the first midterm
        from Prof. Olney's Fall 2015 offering of Economics 1.</i> <i>&nbsp;The

      <div align="left">Question 1 (20 points total; 9 minutes total)<br>
        Many tourists climb Mt Fuji in Japan, which is one of the
        world’s highest mountains: over 12,000 feet or 3,700 meters
        tall.&nbsp; Tourists can purchase water along the route at huts.
        The higher a tourist climbs up the mountain, the higher is the
        price of 1 liter of water. So a tourist pays more for 1 liter of
        water at the 10,000' hut than at the 7,000' hut. Assume water
        sellers on Mt. Fuji are profit-maximizers.&nbsp; And (even
        though it’s unrealistic) assume perfect competition.<br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points)&nbsp; Water sold at huts is
        carried up the mountain by workers, not by vehicles.&nbsp;
        Referring to the costs of production, explain why sellers would
        charge a higher price for 1 liter of water at a higher
        elevation.<br>
        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 points) Most tourists bring their own
        water, but drink it all before reaching the peak.&nbsp;
        Referring to the demand for water, explain why sellers would
        charge a higher price for 1 liter of water at a higher
        elevation. <br>
        c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) We learn that more water is
        sold at higher elevations than at lower elevations.&nbsp; Does
        that information help you determine whether differences in
        supply or differences in demand are primarily responsible for
        the price differences?&nbsp; Explain. Supplement your answer
        with a graph.<br>
        <br>
        Question 2 (10 points; 4 minutes)&nbsp; Royal Dutch Shell is a
        profit-maximizing company that produces and sells oil.&nbsp;
        Last week, Shell announced it would immediately stop all
        offshore oil drilling in the Arctic, even though it had already
        spent $7 billion on the project.&nbsp; They stated that oil
        prices were expected to remain low and future drilling costs
        were expected to rise. Using economic terminology, explain
        Shell’s decision to immediately stop Arctic drilling.&nbsp; In
        your answer, be sure to indicate whether the $7 billion already
        spent on the project is relevant to their decision.<br>
        <br>
        Question 3 (40 points; 18 minutes total)<br>
        In Oregon, farms can grow apples or grapes.&nbsp; Grapes are
        used to make wine.&nbsp; There are hundreds of small farms
        growing grapes and producing wine.&nbsp; Assume the Oregon wine
        industry is perfectly competitive.<br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) Initially, the Oregon wine
        industry was in long-run competitive equilibrium.&nbsp; Draw the
        relevant graphs below for the market and for the typical
        firm.&nbsp; Use subscripts “1” on your labels. <br>
        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12 points) Oregon wine becomes much more
        popular with consumers.&nbsp; In the short run, what happens to
        the price of Oregon wine?&nbsp; To the market quantity?&nbsp; To
        the quantity produced by the typical firm?&nbsp; To the profit
        of the typical firm?&nbsp; Show the effects on your graph above,
        using subscripts “2” on your labels.<br>
        c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8 points) In the long run, what happens in
        the Oregon wine industry?&nbsp; Specify the effects on market
        price, market quantity, typical firm quantity, typical firm
        profit, and the number of firms.&nbsp; Show the effects on your
        graph above, using subscripts “3” on your labels.<br>
        d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points) You can see the effect of the
        increased popularity of Oregon wine as you drive through Oregon:
        acres and acres of apple trees have been torn out, replaced with
        acres and acres of grape vineyards.&nbsp; Each time 10 acres of
        Oregon land is converted from apple orchards to grape vineyards,
        does Oregon’s production of apples fall by the same
        amount?&nbsp; Explain.<br>
        e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 points)&nbsp; Draw Oregon’s PPF (the two
        outputs are apples and grapes).&nbsp; Illustrate two things in
        one graph: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Question 4 (30 points; 13 minutes) This question draws on the
        three reader articles (#9a, 9b, 9c) about Uber. <br>
        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) Taxi rides are sold at a fixed
        price.&nbsp; The price does not fall or rise in response to
        changes in demand. The graph at the right illustrates this
        market.&nbsp; When is the fixed price a price ceiling: when
        demand is low or when demand is high?&nbsp; When demand is high,
        will taxi rides go only to the people with the highest ability
        and willingness to pay?&nbsp; Explain.<br>
        b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) What is Uber’s “surge
        pricing”?&nbsp; Use the model of supply and demand to illustrate
        at right the market for Uber rides.&nbsp; In your graph,
        distinguish between a low-demand time and a high-demand
        time.&nbsp; <br>
        c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 points) When demand is high, is Uber
        price-gouging?&nbsp; In your answer, distinguish between a
        high-demand time such as Halloween or New Year’s Eve and a
        high-demand time such as an unexpected closure of all public
        transit (Bart, bus, etc.). <br>
