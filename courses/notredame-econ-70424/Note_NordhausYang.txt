Nordhaus and Yang AER 1996.

Introduces RICE model. DICE is like a planner's problem. Climate
change is costly to the world. RICE calibrates the production and
climate part to six regions of the world--USA, Japan, China, EU, FSR, ROW>
Therefore, there are 6 decision makers, playing non-cooperatively (Nash). 
Three policy scenerios examined.
1. BAU (they call this market policies). No controls (no policies)
2. Cooperative. Policies enacted to be globally efficient.
3. Noncooperative (Nash)

Estimates cooperative SCC to be $6/ton (2000 USD),
and 24 cents in noncooperative. Also, economic losses from 
global warming is only 1 to 2 percent of global
income over the next century. 

China, Japan, and EU benefit most from cooperative strategy.
Probably why the US doesn't want to play.
