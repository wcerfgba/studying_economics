\begin{center}
{\bf MOTIVATION}
\end{center}
1) Capital income is about 25\% of national income (labor income
is 75\%) but distribution of capital income is much more unequal
than labor income

Capital income inequality is due to differences in savings
behavior but also inheritances received

$\Rightarrow$ Equity suggests it should be taxed more than labor

2) Capital Accumulation correlated strongly with growth [although
causality link is not obvious] and capital accumulation might be
sensitive to the net-of-tax return.

$\Rightarrow$ Efficiency cost of capital taxation might be high.

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center}
{\bf MOTIVATION}
\end{center}

3) Capital more mobile internationally than labor 
%$\Rightarrow$ Incidence of capital taxation might fall on workers:

Key distinction is \textbf{residence} vs. \textbf{source} base capital taxation:

\textbf{Residence: } Capital income tax based on residence of owner of capital.

Most individual income tax systems are residence based (with credits for taxes
paid abroad)

Incidence falls on owner $\Rightarrow$ can only escape
tax through evasion (tax heavens) or changing residence (mobility of persons)

Tax evasion of capital income through tax heavens is a very serious concern (Zucman QJE'13, '15)

\textbf{Source:} Capital income tax based on location of capital (most corporate income tax systems
are source based)

Incidence is then partly shifted to labor if capital is mobile.

Example: Open economy with fully mobile capital and source taxation: 
Local GDP: $wL+rK=F(K,L)=L \cdot F(K/L,1)=L \cdot f(k)$ where $k=K/L$ is capital stock per worker

Net-of-tax rate of return
is fixed by the international rate of return $r^*$ so that
$(1-\tau_c)F_K(K,L)=(1-\tau_c)f'(k)=r^*$ where $k=K/L$ is capital stock per worker and $\tau_c$ corp tax rate

As $wL+r^*K=F(K,L)$, wage $w=F_L(K,L)=f(k)-r^* \cdot k$ falls with $\tau_c$

4) Capital taxation is extremely complex and provides many tax
avoidance opportunities
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center}
{\bf MACRO FRAMEWORK}
\end{center}

Constant return to scale aggregate production:

$Y = F(K,L) = r K + w L$ = output = income

$K$ = capital stock (wealth), $L$ = labor input

$r$ = rate of return on capital, $w$ is wage rate

$rK$ = capital income, $wL$ = labor income

$\alpha=rK/Y$ = capital income share (constant $\alpha$ when
$F(K,L)=K^{\alpha} L^{1-\alpha}$ Cobb-Douglas), $\alpha \simeq
30\%$

$\beta=K/Y$ = wealth to annual income ratio, $\beta \simeq 4-6$

$r= (rK/Y) \cdot (Y/K) = \alpha/\beta$, $r=5-6\%$

%{\bf SAVING FLOWS}
%\end{center}
%Saving is a flow and wealth or net worth is a stock
%
%Three saving flows:
%
%1) {\bf Personal saving:} individual income less individual
%consumption [fell dramatically in the US since 1980s, recent
%$\uparrow$ since 2008]
%
%2) {\bf Corporate Saving:} retained earnings =  after tax profits
%- distributions to shareholders
%
%3) {\bf Government Saving:} Taxes - Expenditures [federal, state
%and local]
%
%Taxes on savings might affect different savings flows differently:
%savings subsidy through a tax credit can $\uparrow$ individual
%savings but $\downarrow$ govt saving [if govt spending stays
%constant]

{\bf Piketty (2014) book: Capital in the 21st Century}
\end{center}
Analyzes income, wealth, inheritance data over the long-run:

1) Growth rate $n+g$ = population growth + growth per capita. Population growth will converge
to zero, growth per capita for frontier economies is modest (1\%) $\Rightarrow$ long-run $g \simeq 1\%, n \simeq 0\%$

2) Long-run steady-state Wealth to income ratio ($\beta$) = savings rate ($s$) / annual growth ($n+g$): $\beta=s/(n+g)$

Proof: $K_{t+1}=(1+n+g) \cdot K_t = K_t + s\cdot Y_t \Rightarrow K_t/Y_t = s /(n+g)$

With $s=8\%$ and $n+g=2\%$, $\beta=400\%$ but with $s=8\%$ and $n+g=1\%$, $\beta=800\%$
$\Rightarrow$ Wealth will become important

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}
\begin{center}
{\bf Piketty (2014) book: Capital in the 21st Century}
\end{center}

3) After-tax rate of return on wealth $\bar{r}=r(1-\tau_K)=4-5\%$ significantly larger than $n+g$ [except exceptional period of 1930--1970]

With $\bar{r} > n+g$, role of inheritance in wealth and wealth concentration become large [past swallows the future]

Explanation: Rentier who saves all his return on wealth accumulates wealth at rate $\bar{r}$ bigger than $n+g$ and hence
his wealth grows relative to the size of the economy. The bigger $\bar{r}-(n+g)$, the easier it is for wealth to ``snowball''

$\Rightarrow$ Capital taxation reduces $r$ to $\bar{r}=r \cdot (1-\tau_K)$ $\Rightarrow$ This can reduce wealth concentration

\begin{center} {\bf WEALTH AND CAPITAL INCOME IN AGGREGATE} \end{center}
{\bf Definition:} Capital Income = Returns from Wealth Holdings

Aggregate US {\bf Personal} Wealth $\simeq$ 4*GDP $\simeq$ \$60 Tr

{\bf Tangible assets:} residential real estate (land+buildings)
[income = rents] and unincorporated business + farm assets [income
= profits]

{\bf Financial assets:} corporate stock [income = dividends +
retained earnings], fixed claim assets (corporate and govt bonds,
bank accounts) [income = interest]

{\bf Liabilities:} Mortgage debt, Student loans, Consumer credit debt

Substantial amount of financial wealth is held indirectly through:
pension funds [DB+DC], mutual funds, insurance reserves

%
%Gross capital income (before depreciation) is about 40\% of GDP
%
%Net capital income (after depreciation) is about 25\% of personal
%income
%
%The capital income share in total income is relatively stable in
%the long-run (but with some short term fluctuations)
%
%Average real rate of return of capital around 5-6\%, varies
%greatly from year to year
%\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf INDIVIDUAL WEALTH AND CAPITAL INCOME} \end{center}

Wealth = $W$, Return = $r$, Capital Income = $rW$

$W_t=W_{t-1}+r_t W_{t-1}+ E_t + I_t - C_t $

where $W_t$ is wealth at age $t$, $C_t$ is consumption, $E_t$
labor income earnings (net of taxes), $r_t$ is the average (net)
rate of return on investments and $I_t$ net inheritances (gifts
received and bequests minus gifts given).

Replacing $W_{t-1}$ and so on, we obtain the following expression
(assuming initial wealth $W_0$ is zero):
$$W_t= \sum_{k=1}^t (E_k-C_k+I_k) \prod_{j=k+1}^{t}(1+r_j)$$
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf INDIVIDUAL WEALTH AND CAPITAL INCOME} \end{center}
$$W_t= \sum_{k=1}^t (E_k-C_k) \prod_{j=k+1}^{t}(1+r_j)+\sum_{k=1}^t I_k\prod_{j=k+1}^{t}(1+r_j)$$

1st term is \textbf{life-cycle} wealth, 2nd term is \textbf{inheritance} wealth

Differences in Wealth and Capital income due to:

1) Age

2) past earnings, and past saving behavior $E_t-C_t$ [life
cycle wealth]

3) Net Inheritances received $I_t$ [transfer wealth]

4) Rates of return $r_t$

\begin{center} {\bf WEALTH DISTRIBUTION} \end{center}
Wealth inequality is very large (much larger than labor income)

US Household Wealth is divided 1/3,1/3,1/3 for the top 1\%, the
next 9\%, and the bottom 90\% [bottom 1/2 households hold almost
no wealth]

Financial wealth is more unequally distributed than (net) real
estate wealth

Share of real estate wealth falls at the top of the wealth
distribution

Growth of private pensions [such as 401(k) plans] has
``democratized'' stock ownership in the US

US public underestimates extent of wealth inequality and thinks the
ideal wealth distribution should be a lot less unequal [Norton-Ariely '11]

%\begin{center} {\bf WEALTH DISTRIBUTION} \end{center}
%Wealth is more unequally distributed than income [true in all
%countries]
%
%Top 1\% income share in the US is around 20\%
%
%Top 1\% labor income share in the US (among workers) is around
%15\%
%
%US Income concentration has increased sharply since 1970:
%
%Top 1\% income share was 9\% in 1970 and 20\%+ in recent years
%[Piketty-Saez QJE'03 updated]
%
%US Wealth concentration has also increased but likely less than income
%
%%Top 1\% wealth share has grown ``only'' from 31\% in 1962 to 34\%
%%in 2007 based on the Survey of Consumer Finances [Scholz '03,
%%Kennickell '09]
%\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf WEALTH MEASUREMENT} \end{center}
In the US, wealth distribution much less well measured than income distribution
because no systematic administrative source (no wealth tax). 3 methods
to estimate wealth distribution:

\textbf{1) Surveys:} US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)

Top 10\% wealth share has grown from 67\% in 1989 to 75\% in 2010

Top 1\% wealth share has grown ``only'' from 30\% in 1989 to 35\%
in 2010 [Kennickell '09, '12]

Problems: small sample size, measurement error, only every 3 years, starts in 1989

\pagebreak

\textbf{2) Estate multiplier method:} use annual estate tax statistics and re-weights individual 
estates by inverse of death probability [based on age$\times$gender$\times$social class]

Kopczuk-Saez NTJ'04 create series 1916-2000 and find fairly small increases in wealth
concentration in recent decades

Problems:  social class effect on mortality not well known, significant estate tax avoidance, noisy
measure of ``young wealth'', estates cover only the super rich (top .1\% in recent years)

\textbf{3) Capitalization method:} use capital income from individuals tax statistics and estimates rates of returns
by asset class to infer wealth: shows big increase
in wealth concentration [Saez-Zucman '14 in progress]

%Piketty (2014) compiles US (and Europe) wealth concentration series

\begin{center} {\bf CAPITAL TAXATION IN THE US} \end{center}

Good US references: Gravelle '94 book, Slemrod-Bakija '04 book

1) {\bf Corporate Income Tax} (fed+state): 35\% Federal tax rate
on profits of corporations [complex rules with many industry
specific provisions]: effective tax rate much lower and incidence
depends on mobility of capital

%[Full expensing means deducting investment costs instead of
%depreciation, amounts to exempting normal rate of return from tax]

2) {\bf Individual Income Tax} (fed+state): taxes many forms of
capital income

Realized capital gains and dividends (dividends since '03 only)
receive preferential treatment

Imputed rent of home owners, returns on pension funds, state+local
government bonds interest are exempt

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf FACTS OF US CAPITAL INCOME TAXATION} \end{center}

3) {\bf Estate and gift taxes:}

Fed taxes estates above \$5.5M exemption (only .1\% of deceased
liable), tax rate is 40\% above exemption (2013+)

Charitable and spousal giving is exempt

Substantial tax avoidance activity through tax accountants

Step-up of realized capital gains at death (lock-in effect)

4) {\bf Property taxes} (local) on real estate (old tax):

Tax varies across jurisdictions. About 0.5\% of market value on
average, like a 10\% tax on imputed rent if return is 5\%

Lock-in effect in states that use purchase price base such as
California

%Note that Value Added Tax (VAT) [does not exist in the US] exempts
%normal return on capital but taxes excess returns

%retirement duration
%
%Individuals earn income $w_t$ from period $0$ to $R$ and earn zero
%afterwards
%
%Individuals have additive separable utility $\sum_{t=1}^T
%u(c_t)/(1+\delta)^t$ with concave $u(.)$
%
%subject to inter-temporal budget constraint: $\sum_{t=1}^T
%c_t/(1+r)^t \leq \sum_{t=1}^R w_t/(1+r)^t$ (multiplier $\lambda$)
%
%FOC: $u'(c_t)/(1+\delta)^t=\lambda / (1+r)^t$
%
%Euler equation: $u'(c_{t+1})/u'(c_t)=(1+\delta)/(1+r)$

{\bf LIFE CYCLE VS. INHERITED WEALTH}
\end{center}
Old view: Tobin and Modigliani: life cycle wealth accounts for the
bulk of the wealth held in the US. Kotlikoff-Summers JPE'81
challenged the old view (debate Kotlikoff vs. Modigliani in JEP'88) 

Why is this question important? 

1) Economic Modeling: what accounts for wealth accumulation and
inequality? Is widely used life-cycle model with no bequests a
good approximation? %[Causality between growth and savings]

2) Policy Implications: taxation of capital income and estates.
Role of pay-as-you-go vs. funded retirement programs

Key problem is that the definition of life-cycle vs. inherited wealth
is not conceptually clean (Modigliani does not capitalize inherited wealth
while Kotlikoff-Summers do) 

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf LIFE CYCLE VS. INHERITED WEALTH} \end{center}
Piketty-Postel-Vinay-Rosenthal EEH'14 (PPVR) propose better definition to resolve Modigliani
vs. Kotlikoff-Summers controversy (see Piketty-Zucman Handbook chapter '14)

Individual wealth accumulation:
\[ W_t= \sum_{k=1}^t (E_k-C_k) \cdot (1+r)^{t-k}+\sum_{k=1}^t I_k \cdot (1+r)^{t-k} \]
\small
If $W_t > \sum_{k=1}^t I_k \cdot (1+r)^{t-k}$ then individual also saves out of labor income $E_k$
and inherited wealth is $\sum_{k=1}^t I_k \cdot (1+r)^{t-k}$

If $W_t \leq \sum_{k=1}^t I_k \cdot (1+r)^{t-k}$ then individual consumes part of inheritances (in addition to labor income)
and inherited wealth is $W_t$

PPVR requires micro-data for implementation. If we assume uniform saving rate $s$, there is a simplified
formula for share of inherited wealth $b_y/[b_y+(1-\alpha) \cdot s]$ with $b_y$ bequest flow/national income
and $\alpha$ capital share

%Two components in the individual wealth equation $W_t$:

%$$T_t= \sum_{k=1}^t I_k (1+r)^{t-k}$$
%Aggregate this over all individuals or households in the economy

{\bf LIFE CYCLE VS. INHERITED WEALTH}
\end{center}
How do the shares of inheritance vs.
life-cycle evolve over time? First measure is inheritance flow to national income

Inheritance share likely huge in the distant past: class society
with rentiers vs. workers [Delong '03]

Inheritance share $\downarrow$ in 20th century but 
has $\uparrow$ recently in France (Piketty QJE'11, Piketty-Zucman '14 handbook chapter)

Post-war period was a time of fast population growth and fast
economic growth $\Rightarrow$  If $n+g$ (growth) large relative to
$r$ (rate of return on wealth) $\Rightarrow$ Inheritances play a
minor role in life-time wealth

In general $r>n+g$ in which case inheritances play a large role in aggregate
wealth and wealth concentration is going back (Western countries moving in that
direction, Piketty '14)

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf TAXES IN OLG LIFE-CYCLE MODEL} \end{center}
$\max \:\: U=u(c_1,l_1)+ \delta u(c_2,l_2)$

No tax situation: earn $w_1l_1$ in period 1, $w_2 l_2$ in period 2

Savings $s=w_1 l_1 - c_1$, $c_2=w_2 l_2 + (1+r)s$

Capital income $r s$

Intertemporal budget with no taxes:

$c_1+c_2/(1+r) \leq w_1 l_1 + w_2 l_2 /(1+r)$

This model has uniform rate of return and does not capture excess
returns
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf TAXES IN OLG MODEL} \end{center}
Budget with consumption tax $t_c$: $$(1+t_c) [ c_1+c_2/(1+r)] \leq
w_1 l_1 + w_2 l_2/(1+r)$$ Budget with labor income tax $\tau_L$:
$$c_1+c_2/(1+r)  \leq (1-\tau_L)[w_1 l_1 + w_2 l_2/(1+r)]$$
Consumption and labor income tax are equivalent if
$$1+t_c=1/(1-\tau_L)$$ Both taxes distort only labor-leisure choice
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf TAXES IN OLG MODEL} \end{center}
Budget with capital income tax $\tau_K$: $$c_1+c_2/(1+r(1-\tau_K))
\leq w_1 l_1 + w_2 l_1/(1+r(1-\tau_K))$$ $\tau_K$ distorts only
inter-temporal consumption choice

Budget with comprehensive income tax $\tau$:
$$c_1+c_2/(1+r(1-\tau)) \leq (1-\tau)[w_1 l_1 + w_2
l_2/(1+r(1-\tau))]$$ $\tau$ distorts both labor-leisure and
inter-temporal consumption choices

$\tau$ imposes ``double'' tax: (1) tax on earnings, (2) tax on
savings
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf EFFECT OF $r$ ON SAVINGS} \end{center}
Assume that labor supply is fixed. Draw graph.
Suppose $r$ $\uparrow$:

1) Substitution effect: price of $c_2$ $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$
$c_2 \uparrow$, $c_1$ $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$  savings
$s=w_1l_1-c_1$ $\uparrow$.

2) Wealth effect: Price of $c_2$ $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ both
$c_1$ and $c_2$ $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ save less

3) Human wealth effect: present discounted value of labor income
$\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ both $c_1$ and $c_2$ $\downarrow$
$\Rightarrow$ save more

Note: If $w_2 l_2 < c_2$ (ie $s>0$), 2)+3) $\Rightarrow$ save less

Total net effect is theoretically ambiguous $\Rightarrow$ $\tau_K$
has ambiguous effects on $s$
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf SHIFT FROM LABOR TO CONSUMPTION TAX} \end{center}
Labor and consumption are equivalent for the individual if
$1+t_c=1/(1-\tau_L)$ but savings pattern is different

Assume $w_2=0$ and $l_1=1$

$(1+t_c)[c_1 + c_2/(1+r)] = w_1$ with consumption tax

$c_1 + c_2/(1+r) = (1-t_L) w_1$ with labor tax

1) Consumption tax $t_c$: $c^c_1=(w_1-s_c)/(1+t_c)$,
$c^c_2=(1+r)s_c/(1+t_c)$

2) Labor income tax $\tau_L$: $c^L_1=w_1(1-\tau_L)-s_L$,
$c^L_2=(1+r)s_L$

Same consumption in both cases so $s_L=s_c/(1+t_c)$ $\Rightarrow$
Save more with a consumption tax
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf TRANSITION FROM LABOR TO C TAX} \end{center}
In OLG model and closed economy, capital stock is due to
life-cycle savings $s$

Start with labor tax $\tau_L$ and switch to a
consumption tax $t_c$

The old [at time of transition] would have paid nothing in labor
tax regime but now have to pay tax on $c_2$

For the young [and future generations], the two regimes look
equivalent so they now save more and increase the capital stock

However, this increase in capital stock comes at the price of
hurting the old who are taxed twice
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf TRANSITION FROM LABOR TO C TAX} \end{center}
Suppose the government keeps the old as well off as in previous
system by exempting them from consumption tax

This creates a deficit in government budget equal to

$d=\tau_L w_1 - t_c c_1 = t_c w_1/(1+t_c) -t_c c_1 = t_c s_L $

Extra saving by the young is $s_c-s_L=t_c s_L$ exactly equal to
government deficit.

{\bf Full neutrality result:} Extra savings of young is equal to
old capital stock + new government deficit $\Rightarrow$ no change
in the aggregate capital stock

Full neutrality depends crucially on same $r$ for govt debt and
aggregate $r$ [in practice: equity premium puzzle]

[Same result for Social Security privatization]

\begin{center} {\bf Life-Cycle model: Atkinson-Stiglitz JpubE '76} \end{center}

Heterogeneous individuals and government uses nonlinear tax on
earnings. Should the govt also use tax on savings?

$V^h= \max U^h(v(c_1,c_2),l)$ st
$c_1+c_2/(1+r(1-\tau_K))=wl-T_L(wl)$

If utility is weakly separable and $v(c_1,c_2)$ is the same for
all individuals, then the government should use only labor income
tax and should not use tax on savings

Recent proof by Laroque EJ '05 or Kaplow JpubE '06.

Tax on savings justified if: 

(1) High skill people have higher
taste for saving (e.g, high skill people have lower discount rate) [Saez, JpubE '02]

(2) $c_2$ is complementary with
leisure
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Life-cycle model: linear labor income tax} \end{center}

Suppose the government can only use linear earnings tax: $wl \cdot (1-\tau_L) + E$

If sub-utility $v(c_1,c_2)$ is also homothetic of degree one [i.e., $v(\lambda c_1,\lambda c_2)=\lambda v(c_1,c_2)$ for all
$\lambda$]
then $\tau_K=0$ is again optimal [linear tax counter-part of Atkinson-Stiglitz, see Deaton, 1979]

In the general case $V^h(c_1,c_2,l)$, optimal $\tau_K$ is not always zero

Old literature considered the Ramsey one-person model of linear taxation and expressed optimal
$\tau_K$ as a function of compensated price and cross-price elastiticities [Corlett-Hague REstud'54,
King, 1980, and Atkinson-Sandmo EJ'80]

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf LIMITS OF LIFE-CYCLE MODEL} \end{center}
Atkinson-Stiglitz shows that life-time savings should not be
taxed, tax only labor income

From justice view: seems fair to not discriminate against savers
if labor earnings is the only source of inequality and is taxed
non-linearly

In reality, capital income inequality also due

(1) difference in rates of returns

(2) shifting of labor income into capital income

(3) inheritances

(1) is not relevant if individuals handle risky assets rationally
(as in CAPM model), probably not a very good assumption
$\Rightarrow$ Tax on lucky returns might be desirable

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf SHIFTING OF LABOR / CAPITAL INCOME} \end{center}
In practice, difficult to distinguish between capital and labor
income [e.g., small business profits, professional traders]

Differential tax treatment can induce shifting:

(1) US C-corporations vs S-corporations: shift from corporate
income (and subsequent realized capital gains) toward individual business
income [Gordon and Slemrod '00]

(2) Carried interest in the US: hedge fund and private equity fund
managers receive fraction of profits of assets they manage for
clients. Those profits are really labor income but are taxed as
realized capital gains

(3) Finnish Dual income tax system: taxes separately capital
income at preferred rates since 1993: Pirttila and Selin SJE'11
show that it induced shifting from labor to capital income
especially among self-employed
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Theory: Shifting of Labor / Capital Income} \end{center}

Extreme case where government cannot distinguish at all between
labor and capital income $\Rightarrow$ Govt observes only $wl+rK$
$\Rightarrow$ Only option is to have identical MTRs at individual
level $\Rightarrow$ General income tax $Tax=T(wl+rK)$

With a finite shifting elasticity, differential MTRs for labor and
capital income taxation induce an additional shifting distortion

The higher the shifting elasticity, the closer the tax rates on
labor and capital income should be [Christiansen and Tuomala
ITAX'08, see also Piketty-Saez Handbook chapter '13]

In practice, this seems to be a very important consideration when
designing income tax systems [especially for top incomes]
$\Rightarrow$ Strong reason for having $\tau_L=\tau_K$ at the top

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Taxation of Inheritances: Welfare Effects} \end{center}
Definitions: donor is the person giving, donee is the person
receiving

Inheritances and inter-vivos transfers raise difficult issues:

(1) Inequality in inheritances contributes to economic inequality:
seems fair to redistribute from those who received inheritances to
those who did not

(2) However, it seems unfair to double tax the donors who worked
hard to pass on wealth to children

$\Rightarrow$ Double welfare effect: inheritance tax hurts donor
(if donor altruistic to donee) and donee (which receives less) [Kaplow, '01]
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Estate Taxation in the United States} \end{center}

Estate federal tax imposes a tax on estates above \$5.5M exemption (only about .1\% of deceased
liable), tax rate is 40\% above exemption (2013+)

Charitable and spousal giving are fully exempt from the tax

E.g.: if Bill Gates / Warren Buffet give all their wealth to charity, they won't pay estate tax

Support for estate tax is pretty weak (``death tax'') but public does not know that estate tax affects
only richest

Support for estate tax increase shots up from 17\% to 53\% when survey respondents are informed that only richest pay it
(Kuziemko-Norton-Saez-Stantcheva '13 do an online Mturk survey experiment)

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Taxation of Inheritances: Behavioral Responses} \end{center}

Potential behavioral response effects of inheritance tax:

(1) reduces wealth accumulation of altruistic donors (and hence
tax base) [no very good empirical evidence, Slemrod-Kopczuk 01]

(2) reduces labor supply of altruistic donors (less motivated to
work if cannot pass wealth to kids) [no good evidence]

(3) induces donees to work more through income effects (Carnegie
effect, decent evidence from Holtz-Eakin,Joulfaian,Rosen QJE'93)

Critical to understand why there are inheritances to decide on
optimal inheritance tax policy. 4 main models of bequests: (a)
accidental, (b) bequests in the utility, (c) manipulative bequest motive, (d)
dynastic
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf ACCIDENTAL BEQUESTS} \end{center}

People die with a stock of wealth they intended to spend on
themselves: Such bequests arise because of imperfect annuity
markets

Annuity is an insurance contract converting lumpsum amount into a
stream of payments till end of life [insurance against risk of
living too long]

Annuity markets are imperfect because of adverse selection
[Finkelstein-Poterba EJ'02, JPE'04] or behavioral reasons
[inertia, lack of planning]

Public retirement programs [and defined benefit private
pensions] are in general mandatory annuities

Newer defined contribution private pensions [401(k)s in the US]
are in general not annuitized
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf ACCIDENTAL BEQUESTS} \end{center}

Bequest taxation has no distortionary effect on behavior of donor
and can only increase labor supply of donees (through income
effects) $\Rightarrow$ strong case for taxing bequests heavily

Kopczuk JPE '03 makes the point that estate tax plays the role of
a ``second-best'' annuity:

Estate tax paid by those who die early, and not by those who die
late $\Rightarrow$ Implicit insurance against risk of living too
long

\textbf{Wealth loving:} Same tax policy conclusion arises if donors have wealth in their
utility function [social status or power, Carroll '98]

Kopczuk-Lupton REStud'07 shows that only 1/2 of people accumulate wealth for
bequest motives

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Bequests in the Utility: Warm Glow Or Altruistic} \end{center}

$u(c)-h(l)+ \delta v(b)$ where $c$ is own consumption, $l$ is
labor supply, and $b$ is net-of-tax bequests left to next
generation and $v(b)$ is warm glow utility of bequests

Budget with no estate tax: $c+b/(1+r) = wl-T_L(wl)$

Budget with bequest tax at rate $\tau_B$: $c+b/[(1+r)(1-\tau_B)] =
wl-T_L(wl)$

Suppose first that $b$ is not bequeathed but used for
``after-life'' consumption [e.g., funerary monument of no value to
next generation]

$\Rightarrow$ Atkinson-Stiglitz implies that $b$ should not be
taxed [$\tau_B=0$] and that nonlinear tax on $wl$ is enough for
redistribution

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf Bequests in the Utility: Warm Glow Or Altruistic} \end{center}

Suppose now that $b$ is given to a heir who derives utility
$v^{heir}(b)$ $\Rightarrow$ $b$ creates a positive externality (to donee) and
hence should be subsidized $\Rightarrow$ $\tau_B<0$ is optimal

Kaplow '01 makes this point informally

Farhi-Werning QJE'10 develop formal model of non-linear Pigouvian
subsidization of bequests with 2 generations and social Welfare:
$$SWF=\int[u(c)-h(l)+\delta v(b) +v^{heir}(b)]f(w)dw$$
The marginal external effect of bequests is $dv^{heir}/db$ and
hence should be smaller for large $b$

$\Rightarrow$ Optimal subsidy rate is smaller for large estates
$\Rightarrow$ progressive estate subsidy

Atkinson-Stiglitz applies when sole source of lifetime income is labor:
\[ c+ b(left)/(1+r)=w l-T(w l) \quad (w = \text{productivity, }
 l = \text{labor supply}) \]

In GE, bequests provide an additional source of life-income:
\[c+b(left)/(1+r)=w l-T(w l)+b(received) \]

$\Rightarrow$ conditional on $w l$, high $b(left)$ is a signal of high $b(received)$
$\Rightarrow$ $b(left)$ should be taxed even with optimal $T(w l)$

$\Rightarrow$ Two-dim. inequality requires two-dim. tax policy tool

\textbf{Extreme example:} no heterogeneity in productivity $w$
but pure heterogeneity in bequests motives $\Rightarrow$
bequest taxation is desirable for redistribution

%Note: bequests generate positive externality on donors and hence should be taxed less (but still >0)

{\bf Optimal Capital Stock and Modified Golden Rule}
\end{center}
\textbf{Modified Golden Rule:} $r=\delta + \gamma \cdot g$ 
\\ with $r=F_K(K,L)=f'(k)$ rate of return,
$\delta$ discount rate, $\gamma$ curvature of $u'(c)=c^{-\gamma}$, $g$ growth rate (per capita).
%Not clear at all that MGR holds in practice.

Proof: \$1 extra in period $t$ gives social welfare $u'(c_t)$

\$$1+r$ extra in period $t+1$ gives social welfare $\frac{(1+r)u'(c_{t+1})}{1+\delta}=\frac{(1+r)u'(c_{t})}{1+\delta} \frac{u'(c_{t+1})}{u'(c_t)}
= \frac{1+r}{(1+\delta)(1+g)^{\gamma}} u'(c_t) $  $\Rightarrow$ $1+r=(1+\delta)(1+g)^{\gamma}$

This is equivalent to $r=\delta + \gamma \cdot g$ when the period is small. QED.

Normatively $\delta = 0$ seems justified. Small capital stock and $r>g$ desirable if $\gamma$ is high

\textbf{Modified Golden Rule:} $r=\delta + \gamma \cdot g$ 

Bequest and capital taxes affect capital stock

However, if govt can use debt, it can control capital  stock
 
If debt used to set optimal capital stock at the Modified Golden Rule) then
effects of taxes on $K$ stock can be ignored $\Rightarrow$
Optimal $K$ stock and optimal redistribution are \textbf{orthogonal}

If K stock is not at Modified Golden Rule, then optimal K tax formulas include
a corrective term

[see King 1980 and Atkinson-Sandmo 1980
in OLG life-cycle model, Piketty-Saez ECMA'13 for models with bequests]

In practice: no reason for MGR to hold, govts do not actively target K stock

Parents use potential bequest to extract favors from children

Empirical Evidence: Bernheim-Shleifer-Summers JPE '85 show that
number of visits of children to parents is correlated with
bequeathable wealth but not annuitized wealth of parents

$\Rightarrow$ Bequest becomes one additional form of labor income
for donee and one consumption good for donor

$\Rightarrow$ Inheritances should be counted and taxed as labor
income for donees

\begin{center} {\bf SOCIAL-FAMILY PRESSURE BEQUESTS} \end{center}

Parents may not want to leave bequests but feel compelled to by
pressure of heirs or society: bargaining between parents and
children

With estate tax, parents do not feel like they need to give as
much $\Rightarrow$ parents are made better-off by the estate tax
$\Rightarrow$ Case for estate taxation stronger [Atkinson-Stiglitz
does not apply and no double counting of bequests]

\begin{center} {\bf CHAMLEY-JUDD: RESULTS} \end{center}

Chamley-Judd show that the capital income tax rate always tends to
zero asymptotically: no capital tax in the long-run: 

Two equivalent ways to understand this result:

(1) A constant
tax on capital income creates an exponentially growing
distortion which is inefficient

(2) The PDV of the capital income tax base is infinitely elastic
with respect to ant increase in $\tau_K$ in the distant future 
[Piketty-Saez '13]

Intuition: $u_c(c_{t+1})/u_c(c_t)=(1+\delta)/(1+r(1-\tau_K)) \Rightarrow$
savings decisions infinitely elastic to $r(1-\tau_K) -\delta$

If $r (1-\tau_K) >\delta$, accumulate
forever. If $r (1-\tau_K) <\delta$, get in debt as much as possible.

1) Taxing initial wealth is most efficient [as this is
lumpsum taxation] $\Rightarrow$ solutions typically bang-bang: tax capital as much
as possible early, then zero

2) Chamley-Judd tax is not time consistent: the government would
like to renege and start taxing capital again

3) Zero-long run tax result is not robust to using progressive
income taxation [Piketty, '01, Saez JpubE'13]

4) Dynastic model requires strong homogeneity assumptions (in
discount rates) to generate reasonable steady states [unlikely to
hold in practice]

5) Introducing stochastic shocks in labor/preferences in dynastic
model leads to finite elasticities (and reasonable optimal tax rates)

period 0 utility is $u(c_0)$

(1) Ability $w$ revealed in period 1, work $l$ and earn $z=wl$,

Solve model backward (assume $c_0$ given):

Period 1: $c_1=wl - R c_0$, choose $l$ to maximize
$u(wl-Rc_0)-h(l)$

$\Rightarrow$ FOC $w u'(wl-Rc_0)=h'(l)$ $\Rightarrow$
$l^*=l(w,c_0)$

Period 0: Choose $c_0$ to maximize: 
\[u(c_0)+ \beta \int [ u(w

FOC for $c_0$ (using envelope condition for $l^*$) $$u'(c_0) =

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center} {\bf MECHANISM DESIGN} \end{center}

Government would like to redistribute from high $w$ to low $w$.
Government does not observe $w$ but can observe $c_0,c_1,z=wl$ and
can set taxes as a function of $c_0,c_1,z$

Equivalently (using revelation principle), govt can offer menu
$(c_0,c_1(w),z(w))_w$ and let individuals truthfully reveal their
$w$

Govt program: choose menu $(c_0,c_1(w),z(w))_w$ to maximize:
\[ SW=u(c_0) + \beta \int [u(c_1(w))-h(z(w)/w)]f(w)dw \text{ st} \]
1) Budget: $c_0 + \int c_1(w)f(w)dw/R \leq \int z(w)f(w)dw/R$

2) Incentive Compatibility (IC): individual $w$ prefers
$c_0,c_1(w),z(w)$ to any other $c_0,c_1(w'),z(w')$

\begin{center} {\bf INVERSE EULER EQUATION} \end{center}
\textbf{Inverse Euler equation} holds at the govt optimum:
$$\frac{1}{u'(c_0)} = \frac{1}{\beta R} \cdot \int \frac{1}{u'(c_1(w))}
f(w)dw$$ \textbf{Proof:} small deviation in menus offered: $\Delta c_0 =
-\varepsilon/u'(c_0)$ and $\Delta c_1(w) = \varepsilon/ [\beta
u'(c_1(w))]$ with small $\varepsilon>0$

Does not affect individual utilities in any state:
\[ u(c_0+\Delta c_0) + \beta u(c_1(w)+\Delta c_1(w))=u(c_0) + \beta
u(c_1(w))\] \[ + \Delta c_0 u'(c_0) + \Delta c_1(w) \beta u'(c_1(w)) =
u(c_0) + \beta u(c_1(w))\]

%$u(c_0) + \beta u(c_1(w)) - \varepsilon + \varepsilon =u(c_0) +
%\beta u(c_1(w))$

$\Rightarrow$ (IC) continues to hold and $SW$ unchanged

Deviation must be budget neutral at optimum
$$\Rightarrow -\frac{\varepsilon}{u'(c_0)}+\frac{1}{R} \int

{\bf Economic intuition:} If high skill person works less (to
imitate lower skill person), person would also like to reduce
$c_0$ and hence save more, so tax on savings is a good way to
discourage imitation

Result depends crucially on rationality in inter-temporal choices + income effects
on labor: not clear yet how applicable this is in practice

Would be valuable to explore empirically for example whether DI (disability insurance) 
cheaters were saving more than non cheaters [would require merging SSA data and
tax/wealth data, hard to do]

\begin{center} {\bf NDPF NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS} \end{center}

Farhi-Werning '11 propose numerical calibration and show that, for
realistic parameters, the welfare gain of using full nonlinear optimal capital/labor taxation
is very small ($0.1\%$ in aggregate welfare) relative to using only optimal labor taxation

Golosov-Troshkin-Tsyvinski '11 also find on average small welfare gains and small
optimal capital tax rates

$\Rightarrow$ Suggests that the mechanism is not quantitatively important even assuming
the theory is right 

$\Rightarrow$ Policy relevance of the NDPF for capital taxation likely to be limited 

DI/retirement application of NDPF might be quantitatively more important
