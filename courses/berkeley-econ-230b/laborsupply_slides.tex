{\bf MOTIVATION}
\end{center}
1) Labor supply responses to taxation are of fundamental
importance for income tax policy [efficiency costs and optimal tax
formulas]

2) Labor supply responses along many dimensions:

(a) Intensive: hours of work on the job, intensity of work,
occupational choice [including education]

(b) Extensive: whether to work or not [e.g., single parent who needs child care, retirement and
migration decisions]

3) Reported earnings for tax purposes can also vary due to (a) tax
avoidance [legal tax minimization], (b) tax evasion [illegal
under-reporting]

4) Different responses in short-run and long-run: long-run
response most important for policy but hardest to estimate

{\bf STATIC MODEL: SETUP}
\end{center}
Baseline model:\ (a) static, (b) linearized tax system, (c) pure
intensive margin choice, (d) single hours choice, (e) no frictions

Let $c$ denote consumption and $l$ hours worked, utility $u(c,l)$
increases in  $c$, and decreases in $l$

Individual earns wage $w$ per hour (net of taxes) and has $y$ in
non-labor income

Key example: pre-tax wage rate $w^p$ and linear tax system with
tax rate $\tau$ and demogrant $G$ $\Rightarrow$  $c=w^p (1-\tau)l +
G$

Individual solves \[ \max_{c,l} u(c,l) \quad \text{subject to} \quad c=wl+y \]
\end{slide}

\begin{center}
{\bf LABOR SUPPLY BEHAVIOR}
\end{center}
FOC: $w u_c + u_l =0$ defines uncompensated (Marshallian)  labor
supply function $l^u(w,y)$

Uncompensated elasticity of labor supply: $\varepsilon^u = (w/l)
\partial l^u/ \partial w$ [\% change in hours when net wage $w
\uparrow$ by 1\%]

Income effect parameter: $\eta = w \partial l / \partial y \leq
0$: \$ increase in earnings if person receives \$1 extra in
non-labor income

Compensated (Hicksian) labor supply function $l^c(w,u)$ which
minimizes cost $ c - wl$ st to constraint $u(c,l) \geq u$.

Compensated elasticity of labor supply: $\varepsilon^c = (w/l)
\partial l^c/ \partial w>0$

Slutsky equation: $\partial l/ \partial w = \partial l^c/ \partial
w + l  \partial l /\partial y$ $\Rightarrow$ $\varepsilon^u =
\varepsilon^c + \eta $

%{\bf IMPORTANT SPECIAL CASE: NO INCOME EFFECTS}
%\end{center}
%Quasi-linear utility function $u(c,l)=c - h(l)$
%
%$\max_l wl+y -h(l)$ $\Rightarrow$ $h'(l)=w$
%
%$\Rightarrow$ Marshallian $l^u(w,y)=l(w)$ labor supply independent
%of $y$
%
%$\Rightarrow$ Hicksian  $l^c(w,u)=l(w)$ labor supply independent
%of $y$ [parallel indifference curves]
%
%$\Rightarrow$ Identical uncompensated and compensated labor supply
%
%$\Rightarrow$  $\eta=0$ and $\epsilon^c = \epsilon^u >0$
%
%Iso-elastic utility function: $u(c,l)=c-a\frac{l^{1+1/\varepsilon }}{%
%^{1+1/\varepsilon }}$ $\Rightarrow$ $w =C \cdot l^{\varepsilon}$

{\bf BASIC CROSS SECTION ESTIMATION}
\end{center}
Data on hours or work, wage rates, non-labor income started
becoming available in the 1960s when first micro surveys and
computers appeared:

Simple OLS regression:
$$l_i = \alpha + \beta w_i + \gamma y_i + X_i \delta +
\epsilon_i$$

$w_i$ is the net-of-tax wage rate

$y_i$ measures non-labor income [including spousal earnings for
couples]

$X_i$ are demographic controls [age, experience, education, etc.]

$\beta$ measures uncompensated wage effects, and $\gamma$ income
effects [can be converted to $\varepsilon^u$, $\eta$]
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center}
{\bf BASIC CROSS SECTION RESULTS}
\end{center}

{\bf 1. Male workers} [primary earners when married] (Pencavel,
1986 survey):

a) Small effects $\varepsilon^u=0$, $\eta=-0.1$, $\varepsilon^c=0.1$
with some variation across estimates (sometimes $\varepsilon^c<0$).

{\bf 2. Female workers} [secondary earners when married]
(Killingsworth and Heckman, 1986):

Much larger elasticities on average, with larger variations across
studies. Elasticities go from zero to over one. Average around
0.5. Significant income effects as well

Female labor supply elasticities have declined overtime as women
become more attached to labor market (Blau-Kahn JOLE'07)

{\bf KEY ISSUE: $w$ correlated with tastes for work}
\end{center}
\[l_i = \alpha + \beta w_i + \gamma  y_i + \epsilon_i\]
Identification is based on cross-sectional variation in $w_i$:
comparing hours of work of highly skilled individuals (high $w_i$)
to hours of work of low skilled individuals (low $w_i$)

If highly skilled workers have more taste for work (independent of
the wage effect), then $\epsilon_i$ is positively correlated with
$w_i$ leading to an upward bias in OLS

Plausible scenario: hard workers acquire better education and
hence have higher wages

Controlling for $X_i$ can help but can never be sure that we have
controlled for all the factors correlated with $w_i$ and tastes
for work: {\bf Omitted variable bias} 

$\Rightarrow$ Tax changes
provide more compelling identification
\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}
%\begin{center}
%{\bf ISSUE 2: Measurement error in hours}
%\end{center}
%In general $w$ computed as earnings / hours $\Rightarrow$ Can
%create division bias
%
%Let $l^{\ast }$ denote true hours, $l$ observed hours
%
%Compute $w=z/l$ where $z$ is observed earnings%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%&\Rightarrow &\log l=\log l^{\ast }+\mu \quad  \mathrm{measurement} \quad \mathrm{error} \\
%&\Rightarrow &\log w=\log z-\log l=\log z-\log l^{\ast }-\mu =\log
%w^{\ast }-\mu
%\end{eqnarray*}%
%Spurious negative correlation between $\log l$ and $\log w$ [e.g,
%workers with high misreported hours also have low imputed wages]
%biasing elasticity estimate downward
%
%Solution:\ tax instruments again
%\end{slide}


%\begin{slide}
%\begin{center}
%{\bf ISSUE 3: Non-participation}
%\end{center}
%Consider model with fixed costs of working, where some individuals
%choose not to work
%
%Wages are unobserved for non-labor force participants
%
%Thus, OLS regression on workers only includes observations with $%
%l_{i}>0$
%
%This can bias OLS\ estimates: low wage earners must have very high
%unobserved propensity to work to find it worthwhile
%
%Requires a selection correction pioneered by Heckman in 1970s
%(e.g. Heckit, Tobit, or ML estimation): problem is that
%identification is based on strong functional form assumptions [See
%Killingsworth and Heckman (1986) for implementation]
%
%Current approach: use tax instruments and look directly at participation
%margin
%\end{slide}


%\begin{slide}%
%\begin{center}
%{\bf Extensive vs. Intensive Margin}
%\end{center}
%
%Related issue:\ want to understand effect of taxes on labor force
%participation decision
%
%With fixed costs of work, individuals may jump from
%non-participation to part time or full time work (non-convex
%budget set)
%
%This can be handled using a discrete choice model:%
%\[
%P=\phi (\alpha +\varepsilon \log (1-\tau )-\eta y)
%\]
%where $P\in \{0,1\}$ is an indicator for whether the individual
%works
%
%Function $\phi $ typically specified as logit, probit, or linear
%prob model
%
%Note:\ here it is critical to have tax variation; regression
%cannot be run with wage variation
%
%\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}
%\begin{center}
%{\bf  ISSUE 4: Non-hours responses}
%\end{center}
%Traditional literature focused purely on hours of work and labor
%force participation
%
%Problem: income taxes distort many margins beyond hours of work
%
%a) Non-hours margins may be more important quantitatively
%
%b) Hours very hard to measure (most ppl report 40 hours per week)
%
%Two solutions in modern literature:
%
%a) Focus on total earnings ($z=wl$) [or taxable income]  as a
%broader measure of labor supply
%
%b) Focus on subgroups of workers for whom hours are better
%measured, e.g. taxi drivers

%{\bf ISSUE 5: NON-LINEAR BUDGET SETS}
%\end{center}
%Actual tax system is not linear but piece-wise linear with varying
%marginal tax rate $\tau$ due to (a) means-tested transfer
%programs, (b) progressive individual income tax
%
%%Individual maximization problem:
%%
%%$\max u(w^pl-T(w^pl),l)$ $\Rightarrow$ FOC $u_c w^p(1-T')+u_l=0$
%
%Same theory applies when considering the linearized tax system
%$c=wl+y$ with $w=w^p(1-T')$ and $y$ defined as virtual income
%(intercept of budget with x-axis when setting $l=0$)
%
%Main complications: 
%
%(a) $w$ [and $y$] become endogenous to choice
%of $l$
%
%(b) FOC may not hold if individual bunches at a kink
%
%(c) FOC may not characterize the optimum choice

%
%2) Econometric bias: $\tau _{i}=T'(w_il_i)$ and $y_i$ depends on income $w_{i}l_{i}$
%and hence on $l_{i}$

%{\bf OLD NON-LINEAR BUDGET SET METHOD}
%\end{center}
%Issue addressed by non linear budget set studies pioneered by
%Hausman in late 1970s (Hausman, 1985 PE handbook chapter)
%
%Method uses a structural model of labor supply to derive and estimate
%labor supply function fully consistent with theory
%
%Key point: the method still uses the standard cross-sectional variation
%in pre-tax wages $w^p$ for identification. Taxes are seen as a
%problem to deal with rather than an opportunity for
%identification.
%
%New literature identifying labor supply elasticities using tax
%changes has a totally different perspective: taxes are seen as an

%
%Non-linear budget set creates two problems:
%
%1) Model mis-specification:\ OLS regression no longer recovers

%
%Two reasons:\ (a)\ underestimate response because people pile up

%{\bf NON-LINEAR BUDGET SET METHOD}
%\end{center}
%
%1) Assume an\ uncompensated labor supply equation:%
%\[
%l=\alpha +\beta w(1-\tau )+\gamma y+\epsilon
%\]
%
%2) Error term $\epsilon $ is normally distributed with variance
%$\sigma ^{2}$
%
%3) Observed variables: $w_{i}$, $\tau _{i}$, $y_{i}$, and $l_{i}$
%
%4) Technique: (a) construct likelihood function given observed
%labor supply choices on NLBS, (b) find parameters ($\alpha ,\beta
%,\gamma $) that maximize likelihood
%
%5) Important insight:\ need to use \textquotedblleft virtual
%incomes\textquotedblright\ in lieu of actual unearned income with
%NLBS
%
%\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}%
%\begin{center}
%{\bf NLBS Likelihood Function (2 brackets)}
%\end{center}
%Individual can locate on first bracket, on second bracket, or at
%the kink $l_{K}$
%
%Likelihood = probability that we see individual $i$ at labor supply $%
%l_{i}$ given a parameter vector
%
%Decompose likelihood into three components
%
%Component 1:\ individual $i$ on first bracket: $0<l_{i}<l_{K}$%
%$$l_{i}=\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{1})+\gamma y^{1}+\epsilon
%_{i}$$
%
%Error $\epsilon _{i}=l_{i}-(\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau
%^{1})+\gamma y^{1})$. Likelihood:$ L_{i}=\phi ((l_{i}-(\alpha
%+\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{1})+\gamma y^{1})/\sigma )$
%
%Component 2: individual $i$ on second bracket: $l_{K}<l_{i}$:
%$L_{i}=\phi ((l_{i}-(\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{2})+\gamma
%y^{2})/\sigma )$
%\end{slide}
%
%
%\begin{slide}%
%\begin{center}
%{\bf NLBS\ Likelihood Function}
%\end{center}
%Now consider individual $i$ located at the kink point
%
%1) If tax rate is $\tau ^{1}$ and virtual income $y^{1}$
%individual wants to work $l>l_{K}$
%
%2) If tax is $\tau ^{2}$ and virtual income $y^{2}$ individual
%wants to work $l<l_{K}$
%
%
%3) These inequalities imply:%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{1})+\gamma y^{1}+\epsilon _{i} &>&l_{K}>\alpha
%+\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{2})+\gamma y^{2}+\epsilon _{i} \\
%l_{K}-(\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{1})+\gamma y^{1} &<&\epsilon
%_{i}<l_{K}-(\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{2})+\gamma y^{2})
%\end{eqnarray*}
%
%4) Contribution to likelihood is probability that error lies in
%this
%range:%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%L_{i} &=&\Psi \lbrack (l_{K}-(\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{2})+\gamma
%y^{2}))/\sigma ] \\
%&&-\Psi \lbrack (l_{K}-(\alpha +\beta w_{i}(1-\tau ^{1})+\gamma
%y^{1}))/\sigma ]

%
%\begin{slide}%
%\begin{center}
%{\bf Maximum Likelihood Estimation}
%\end{center}
%1) Log likelihood function is $L=\sum_{i}\log L_{i}$
%
%2) Final step is solving%
%\[
%\max L(\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\sigma )
%\]
%
%3) In practice, likelihood function much more complicated because
%of more kinks, non-convexities, and covariates
%
%4) But basic technique remains the same

%
%a) Finds significant compensated elasticities and large income
%effects
%
%b) Elasticities larger for women than for men
%
%2) Shortcomings of this implementation
%
%a) Sensitivity to functional form choices, which is a larger issue
%with structural estimation
%
%b) No tax reforms, so does not solve fundamental econometric
%problem that\ tastes for work may be correlated with $w$

%{\bf NLBS and Bunching at Kinks}
%\end{center}
%
%Subsequent studies obtain different estimates (MaCurdy, Green, and
%Paarsh 1990, Blomquist 1995)
%
%a) Several studies find \textbf{negative} compensated wage
%elasticity estimates
%
%b) Debate:\ impose requirement that compensated elasticity is
%positive or conclude that data rejects model?
%
%Fundamental source of problem: labor supply model predicts that
%individuals should bunch at the kink points of the tax schedule
%
%a) But we observe very little bunching at kinks (Heckman vs.
%Hausman), so model is rejected by the data
%
%b) Interest in NLBS\ models diminished despite their conceptual

%{\bf Problems with NIT Experimental Design}

%Estimates from NIT\ not considered fully credible due to several
%shortcomings:
%
%1) {\bf Self reported earnings:} Treatments had financial
%incentives to under-report earnings $\Rightarrow$ Lesson: need to
%match with administrative records [Greenberg and Halsey JOLE'83]
%
%2) {\bf Selective attrition:}
%
%After initial year, data collected based on voluntary income
%reports by families $\Rightarrow$ Those in less generous
%groups/far above break-even point had much less incentive to
%report $\Rightarrow$ Attrition rates higher in these groups
%$\Rightarrow$ No longer a random sample of treatment + controls

{\bf From true experiment to ``natural experiments'': \\ income effects on lottery winners}
\end{center}
True experiments are costly to implement and hence rare

Real economic world provides variation that can
be exploited to estimate behavioral responses $\Rightarrow$
\textbf{Natural Experiments}

Natural experiments can come very close to true experiments:

Imbens, Rubin, Sacerdote AER '01 did a survey of lottery winners
and non-winners matched to Social Security administrative data to
estimate income effects

Lottery generates random assignment conditional on playing

Find significant but relatively small income effects: $\eta = w
\partial l/\partial y$ between -0.05 and -0.10

Identification threat: differential response-rate among groups

{\bf Difference-in-Difference (DD) methodology}
\end{center}

Two groups: Treatment group (T) which faces a change [lottery winners] and control group (C) which does not [non winners]

Compare the evolution of T group (before and after change) to the evolution of the C group (before and after change)

DD identifies the \textbf{treatment effect} if the \textbf{parallel trend assumption} holds:

Absent the change, $T$ and $C$ would have evolved in parallel 

DD most convincing when groups are very similar to start with

Should always test DD using data from more periods and plot the two time
series to check parallel trend assumption

In 2003, Germany made secondary jobs (paying less than 400 Euros/month) tax free:
amounts to a 20-60\% subsidy on second job earnings (depending on family marginal tax rate) $\Rightarrow$ almost pure substitution labor supply effect

Tazhitdinova '20 uses social security admin monthly earnings data

Fraction of population holding second jobs increased sharply (from 2.5\% to 6-7\%)
with bigger response overtime

Finds no offsetting effect on primary earnings $\Rightarrow$ People did work more

Looks like a big labor supply response but likely happened because employers 
willing to create lots of mini-jobs to accommodate supply

{\bf Welfare Reform and EITC Expansion: Labor supply}

Incredible increase in labor force participation of single mothers during the 1990s
when welfare reform and EITC expansion happened

Unlikely that the EITC can explain it because other EITC changes haven't generated
such large effects

Sociological evidence shows that welfare reform ``scared'' single mothers into working

Single moms in the US were suddenly expected to work

economic upturn, and changing social norms lead to this shift

{\bf Bunching at Kinks (Saez AEJ-EP'10)}
\end{center}
Key prediction of standard labor supply model: individuals should bunch
at (convex) kink points of the budget set

1) The only non-parametric source of identification for intensive
elasticity in a single cross-section of earnings is amount of
bunching at kinks creating by tax/transfer system

%2) All other tax variation is contaminated by heterogeneity in
%tastes

2) Saez '10 develops method of using bunching at kinks to estimate the
compensated income elasticity

%4) Idea: if this non-parametric method does not recover
%positive compensated elasticities, then little value in additional
%structure of nonlinear budget set models

Formula for elasticity: 
$ \varepsilon ^{c}=\frac{dz/z^{\ast }}{dt/(1-t)}=$ excess mass at
kink / change in NTR

$\Rightarrow$ Amount of bunching proportional to compensated elasticity

year-to-year income variation too small to erase bunching if
elasticity is large

Evidence of response along extensive margin but little
evidence of response along intensive margin (except for

of the program

Qualitative surveys show that:

Low income families know about EITC and understand that they get a
tax refund if they work

However very few families know whether tax refund $\uparrow$ or
$\downarrow$ with earnings

Such confusion might be good for the government as the EITC
induces work along participation margin without discouraging work
along intensive margin (Liebman-Zeckhauser '04, Rees-Jones and Taubinsky '16)

{\bf Bunching at Notches: Kleven and Waseem '13}
\end{center}
Taxes and transfers sometimes also generate \textbf{notches} (=discontinuities) in the budget set

Such discontinuities should create bunching (and gaps) in the resulting distributions

Kleven and Waseem QJE'13 pioneered tax notch analysis in the case of the Pakistani
income tax where \textbf{average} tax rate jumps

$\Rightarrow$ Bunching below the notch and gap in density just above the notch

Recently Londono-Velez and Avila (2018) use notch analysis to study wealth tax in Columbia

They show clean prior-year counterfactual overcoming the Blomquist et al. '21 critique

%Example: Pakistani income tax creates notches because \textbf{average} tax rate jumps
%$\Rightarrow$ Bunching below the notch and gap in density just above the notch
%
%\textbf{Empirically:} Kleven and Waseem QJE'13 find
%evidence of bunching (primarily among self-employed)
%but size of the response is quantitatively small
%

\end{center}
With optimization frictions (lack of information, costs of adjustment),
a fraction of individuals fail to respond to notch

Kleven-Waseem use empirical density in the theoretical gap area to measure the fraction
of unresponsive individuals

This allows them to back up the frictionless elasticity (i.e. the elasticity
among responsive individuals)

The frictionless elasticity is much higher than the reduced form elasticity
but remains still relatively modest

Bunching method applied to many settings with nonlinear budgets with convex kink points or notches (Kleven '16 survey):

\small

$\bullet$ Individual tax (Bastani-Selin '14 Sweden, Mortenson-Whitten '16 US) 

$\bullet$ Payroll tax (Tazhidinova '15 on UK)

$\bullet$ Corporate tax (Devereux-Liu-Loretz '14, Bachas-Soto '17)

$\bullet$ Wealth tax (Seim '17, Jakobsen et al. '17, Londono-Velez and Avila '18)

$\bullet$ Health spending (Einav-Finkelstein-Schrimpf '13 on Medicare Part D)

$\bullet$ Retirement savings (401(k) matches)

$\bullet$ Retirement age (Brown '13 on California Teachers)

$\bullet$ Housing transactions (Best and Kleven, 2017)

General findings: 

(1) clear bunching when information is salient and outcome easily manipulable.
Bunching comes most often from avoidance/evasion rather than real behavior.

(2) bunching is almost always small relative to conventional
elasticity estimates

{\bf Responses to Corporate Tax Notches: Bachas-Soto '18}
\end{center}
Bachas and Soto '18 exploit the notched Costa Rica corporate tax system
to estimate compellingly the effects of the corporate tax rate on reported profits

Corporate tax applies to profits = revenue minus costs

But tax rate depends on size of revenue with 3 rates: 10\%, 20\%, 30\%

1) Firms bunch at the notches to benefit from the lower rates

2) Most importantly: clear evidence that profit rates (profits/revenue) is strongly affected
by the corporate tax rate

%Key Assumption for inter-temporal budget is {\bf no credit

%U_{c_{t}}(c_{0},..,c_{T},l_{0},..,l_{T})-\lambda /(1+r)^{t} &=&0

%\[ s.t. \:\:\: \sum_{t=0}^{T}
%c_{t}/(1+r)^{t}  \leq A_{0}+\sum_{t=0}^{T} w_{t}l_{t}/(1+r)^{t} \:\:\: (\lambda ) \]

%Leads to first order conditions%

%l_{t} &:&\beta ^{t}u_{l_{t}}+\lambda w_{t}/(1+r)^{t}=0 \\
%c_{t} &:&\beta ^{t}u_{c_{t}}-\lambda /(1+r)^{t}=0

%%Combining yields: $-u_{l}=w_{t}u_{c}$
%
%Intratemporal FOC same as in static model: $-u_{l}=w_{t}u_{c}$

%c_{t} &=&c(w_{t},\lambda /(\beta (1+r))^{t})
%\end{eqnarray*}
%3) Current labor and consumption choice depends on current $w_{t}$
%
%4) All other wage rates and initial wealth enter only through the
%budget constraint multiplier $\lambda $ (MaCurdy 1981)
%
%%5) Easy to see for separable utility [$u(c)$ concave, $v(l)$

%%\begin{eqnarray*}

Concern that taxes funding social state could discourage work

\textbf{Standard econ view:} labor supply $l(w,R)$ coming out of \\ $\max u(\underset{+}{c},\underset{-}{l})$ st $c=wl+R$

\textbf{Social determinants of labor supply:}

a) Youth labor is regulated by labor laws/education

b) Old age labor regulated by retirement programs

c) Female market labor driven by norms + child care policy

d) Hours of work regulated by overtime + vacation mandates

{\bf Long-term effects: Evidence from the Israeli Kibbutz}
\end{center}
Abramitzky '18 book based on series of academic papers

Kibbutz are egalitarian and socialist communities in Israel, thrived for 
almost a century within a more capitalist society

1) Social sanctions on shirkers effective in small communities with limited privacy

2) Deal with brain drain exit using communal property as bond 

3) Deal with adverse selection in entry with screening and trial period 

4) Perfect sharing in Kibbutz has negative effects on high school students performance
but effect is small in magnitude (concentrated among kids with low education parents)

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center}
{\bf Long-term effects: Evidence from the Israeli Kibbutz}
\end{center}
Abramitzky-Lavy ECMA'14 show that 
high school students study harder once their 
kibbutz shifts away from equal sharing

Uses a DD strategy: pre-post reform and comparing reform Kibbutz to non-reform Kibbutz.
Finds that

1) Students are 3\% points more likely to graduate

2)  Students are 6\% points more likely to achieve a matriculation 
certificate that meets university entrance requirements

3)  Students get an average of 3.6 more points in their exams

Effect is driven by students whose parents have 
low schooling; larger for males; stronger in 
kibbutz that reformed to greater degree

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{center}
{\bf Culture of Welfare across Generations}
\end{center}
Conservative concern that welfare promotes a culture of dependency: kids growing up
in welfare supported families are more likely to use welfare

Correlation in welfare use across generations is obviously not necessarily causal 

Dahl, Kostol, Mogstad QJE'2014 analyze causal effect of parental use of Disability Insurance (DI)
on children use (as adults) of DI in Norway

Identification uses random assignment of judges to denied DI applicants who appeal [some judges are severe, some lenient] 

Find evidence of causality: parents on DI increases odds of kids on DI over next 5 years by 6 percentage points

\small
Mechanism seems to be learning about DI availability rather than reduced stigma from using DI [because no effect on other
welfare programs use]

%Strong evidence that labor supply is not purely an individual decision based on

%
%Firms cooperation needed in most cases 
%
%Social norms play large role: e.g. women's market labor supply
%
%US women labor force participation during World War II: 50\% increase from '40 to '45
%(2/3 reversed afterwards)
%
%Child penalties in female earnings vary a lot across countries (Kleven et al. AEA PP'19) and are not due solely
%to monetary incentives
